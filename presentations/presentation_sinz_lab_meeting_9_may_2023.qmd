## Background

-   "Eddy Covariance" state of the art technique to measure **greenhouse gas exchanges**
-   measurement set-up includes instruments for meteorological variables (eg. air temperature, wind speed)
-   technical issues (eg. broken sensor) result in **meteo time series** with **gaps**
-   presence of gaps is a problem for many applications of the Eddy Covariance data (eg. ecosystem modelling)
-   gaps are filled using models

## How to impute gaps

in multivariate time series:

- use other observations before and after the gap and exploit the variable temporal autocorrelation
- use statistical dependency with other (non missing) variables
- use other timeseries that measure similar variables


## State of the art

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS)
  
  - use mean of all other observations from similar meteorological conditions (close in time and in values of other variables)
  - most commonly used method and default for short gaps
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Global meteorological dataset (ERA-I)

  - global dataset using weather models
  - limited spatial/temporal resolution
  - not all variables are available

## Example imputation

## Potential for Improvements

- **temporal autocorrelation**: observations closer to the gap should have a stronger weight in the prediction

- **combine imputation approaches**: use information both from the local time series and the global dataset 

- **Uncertainty**: provide a quantifiable and interpretable uncertainty in the predictions

## Contributions of this work {.smaller}

1. develop a new imputation methods that uses Kalman Filter as it allows to:

    - use variable temporal autocorrelation
    - use inter-variable correlation
    - use global dataset
    - uncertainty of predictions
    - computationally efficient
  
2. evaluate the KF imputation performance

    - compare with SoTA methods
    - explore aspects affect KF performance

# Kalman Filter

## Kalman Filter assumptions

- the observed variables ($y_t$) depend on a latent state of system
- the latent states ($x_t$) are connected by a Markov Chain $p(x_t|x_{t-1}) = p(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ..., x_0)$
- all distributions are Gaussian and relationship are linear


## Kalman Filter for imputation

- predict time at next time state ($x_{t+1}$) using current state ($x_{t+1}$) and potentially a control variable
- correct the state distribution using the observed variable ($y_t$) **if available**
- update state backward in time (smoothing)
- the missing observations can be then predicted from the state



## Kalman Filter with images

## Kalman Filter with equations

$$
\begin{align}
p(x_t | x_{t-1}) &= \mathcal{N}(x_t; Ax_{t-1} + d + Bc_t, Q) \\
p(y_t | x_t) &= \mathcal{N}(y_t; Hx_t + b, R)
\end{align}
$$

## Kalman Filter implementation

- KF equations derived using Bayesian inference + properties of Gaussian distributions
- naive equations are numerically unstable
- custom implementation in PyTorch


## Model training

- data from one site (Hainich, Germany) 
- ERA-I as control variable
- create artificial gaps
- find optimal parameters using gradient descend
- loss function negative log likelihood

# Results

## Control variable

## Other variables availability

# Discussion and Conclusions

## Conclusions

- KF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
- KF provides uncertainty predictions
- imputation performance changes a lot between variables
- KF performance decreases for longer gaps
- numerical stability issues limit applications of current implementation for long gaps in all variables
- difficult to train the KF: parameters initialisation and training data

## KF application

- can be applied now to improve imputation (especially short gaps)
- need to indentify best approach to fine-tune model to each condition/variable
- should not be used for precipitation

## Future outlook

- better mitigation numerical stability
- use latest ERA-I data
- add non-linear relationships
- more robust model evaluation
