  abstract = {Mansonia altissima is an important West African timber tree species. For the purpose of examining the effect of human impact on its genetic diversity, genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of the species under different regimes of human impact were investigated in the Akure Forest Reserve, Nigeria, using 504 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The results indicate a very low genetic diversity in M. altissima within the forest reserve (He = 0.045; PPL = 16.75\%; Br = 1.162). The highest genetic diversity was observed in the primary forest (He = 0.062; PPL = 21.00\%; Br = 1.204), with the lowest genetic diversity in the isolated forest patch (He = 0.032; PPL = 9.00\%; Br = 1.089). A significant and pronounced spatial genetic structure was found in the logged forest and in the isolated forest patch. In contrast, the primary forest exhibited very weak spatial genetic structuring. As expected, no spatial genetic structure was found in the planted stands of M. altissima. From a conservation point of view, our results suggest that genetic diversity of M. altissima is at risk in the forest reserve. The scale of human impact in the study area could pose a serious threat to the maintenance of genetic diversity of the species. These results would offer practical applications in the conservation of other tropical tree species.},

Because no standard method of gap filling has been widely accepted, identification of optimal filling methods for gaps is crucial for determining total evapotranspiration. In this study we evaluate the application of a Kalman filter for filling gaps in latent heat flux data collected from an agricultural research station. The filtering approach was compared with several gap-filling methods including mean diurnal variation, multiple regressions, 2-week average Priestley\textendash Taylor coefficient, and multiple imputation. The results demonstrated that a Kalman filtering approach developed using the relationship between latent heat flux, available energy, and vapour pressure deficit provides a closer approximation of the original data and introduces smaller errors than the other methods evaluated. Evaluation of the Kalman filter approach demonstrates the efficiency of this technique in replacing data in both small and large gaps of up to several days.},

  abstract = {The consequences of silviculture and management on the genetic variation and structure of long-impacted populations of forest tree are reviewed assessed and discussed, using Mediterranean forests as a working paradigm. The review focuses on silviculture and management systems, regeneration schemes, the consequences of coppicing and coppice conversion to high forest, the effects of fragmentation and exploitation, and the genetic impact of forestry plantations. It emerges that averaging genetic diversity parameters, such as those typically reported in the assessment of forest population genetics, do not generally present significant differences between populations under certain silvicultural systems/forest management methods and \&ldquo;control\&rdquo; populations. Observed differences are usually rather subtler and regard the structure of the genetic variation and the lasting adaptive potential of natural forest tree populations. Therefore, forest management and silvicultural practices have a longer-term impact on the genetic diversity and structure and resilience of long-impacted populations of forest tree; their assessment should be based on parameters that are sensitive to population perturbations and bottlenecks. The nature and extent of genetic effects and impact of silviculture and forest management practices, call for a concerted effort regarding their thorough study using genetic, genomic, as well as monitoring approaches, in order to provide insight and potential solutions for future silviculture and management regimes.},

During the period 1986\textendash 1991, irradiated and damaged forest stands, so-called `red forest', located in this area were systematically classified by observation. Mortality rate, re-establishment, development of tree canopies, reproduction anomalies and stand viability were shown to be dependent on absorbed irradiation dose, on the age of the stand and on forest composition. For pine stands in the acutely affected zone, doses of more than 60 Gy resulted in a massive mortality and no regeneration of pine trees since 1987. The injured trees had burned or had dried-up. The drying process was accelerated by a massive production of pathogenic insects invading the dying trees. Specifically, irradiation doses of 10\textendash 60 Gy, 1\textendash 10 Gy and 0.1\textendash 1 Gy caused high, medium and low injury to the forest stands, respectively. Doses of less than 0.1 Gy did not cause any visible damage to the trees. In 1987, repair processes were displayed by the tree canopies and practically the entire viability of the forest stands had recovered except for trees in the acute and highly affected zones. The young forest was reestablished in the same place as the perished trees and new pine saplings were planted on the reclaimed areas.},

  abstract = {We present DeepMVI, a deep learning method for missing value imputation in multidimensional time-series datasets. Missing values are commonplace in decision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from disparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of missing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety of algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods like SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning methods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics compared to just excluding the missing data. DeepMVI uses a neural network to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained patterns along a time series, and trends from related series across categorical dimensions. After failing with off-the-shelf neural architectures, we design our own network that includes a temporal transformer with a novel convolutional window feature, and kernel regression with learned embeddings. The parameters and their training are designed carefully to generalize across different placements of missing blocks and data characteristics. Experiments across nine real datasets, four different missing scenarios, comparing seven existing methods show that DeepMVI is significantly more accurate, reducing error by more than 50\% in more than half the cases, compared to the best existing method. Although slower than simpler matrix factorization methods, we justify the increased time overheads by showing that DeepMVI is the only option that provided overall more accurate analytics than dropping missing values.},

The Australian regional flux network (OzFlux) currently has 23 active sites and aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate for improved predictions. Given the need for standardised and effective data processing of flux data, we have developed a software suite, called the Dynamic INtegrated Gap-filling and partitioning for OzFlux (DINGO), that enables gap-filling and partitioning of the primary fluxes into ecosystem respiration (Fre) and gross primary productivity (GPP) and subsequently provides diagnostics and results. We outline the processing pathways and methodologies that are applied in DINGO (v13) to OzFlux data, including (1) gap-filling of meteorological and other drivers; (2) gap-filling of fluxes using artificial neural networks; (3) the \emph{u}* threshold determination; (4) partitioning into ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity; (5) random, model and \emph{u}* uncertainties; and (6) diagnostic, footprint calculation, summary and results outputs. DINGO was developed for Australian data, but the framework is applicable to any flux data or regional network. Quality data from robust systems like DINGO ensure the utility and uptake of the flux data and facilitates synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The positive result of this study is that the U-D covariance factorization algorithm has excellent numerical properties and is computationally efficient, having CPU costs that differ negligibly from the conventional Kalman costs. Accuracies of the U-D filter using single precision arithmetic consistently match the double precision reference results. Numerical stability of the U-D filter is further demonstrated by its insensitivity to variations in the a priori statistics.},

In particular, carbon and energy fluxes play a major role in understanding biogeochemical processes on an ecosystem level or global scale. However, the fluxes can only be measured at individual sites, e.g., by eddy covariance towers, and an upscaling of these local observations is required to analyze global patterns. Previous work focused on upscaling monthly, 8-day, or daily average values, and global maps for each flux have been provided accordingly. In this paper, we raise the upscaling of carbon and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere to the next level by increasing the temporal resolution to subdaily timescales. We provide continuous half-hourly fluxes for the period from 2001 to 2014 at 0.5\textdegree{} spatial resolution, which allows for analyzing diurnal cycles globally. The data set contains four fluxes: gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H). We propose two prediction approaches for the diurnal cycles based on large-scale regression models and compare them in extensive cross-validation experiments using different sets of predictor variables. We analyze the results for a set of FLUXNET tower sites showing the suitability of our approaches for this upscaling task. Finally, we have selected one approach to calculate the global half-hourly data products based on predictor variables from remote sensing and meteorology at daily resolution as well as half-hourly potential radiation. In addition, we provide a derived product that only contains monthly average diurnal cycles, which is a lightweight version in terms of data storage that still allows studying the important characteristics of diurnal patterns globally. We recommend to primarily use these monthly average diurnal cycles, because they are less affected by the impacts of day-to-day variation, observation noise, and short-term fluctuations on subdaily timescales compared to the full half-hourly flux products. The global half-hourly data products are available at {$<$}a href="https://doi.org/10.17871/BACI.224" target="\_blank"{$>$}https://doi.org/10.17871/BACI.224{$<$}/a{$>$}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We use global, spatially gridded GPP and latent heat flux upscaled from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers to evaluate and improve canopy processes in CLM4. We investigate differences in GPP and latent heat flux arising from model parameterizations (termed model structural error) and from uncertainty in the photosynthetic parameter Vcmax (termed model parameter uncertainty). Model structural errors entail radiative transfer, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and canopy scaling of leaf processes. Model structural revisions reduce global GPP over the period 1982\textendash 2004 from 165 Pg C yr-1 to 130 Pg C yr-1, and global evapotranspiration decreases from 68,000 km3 yr-1 to 65,000 km3 yr-1, within the uncertainty of FLUXNET-based estimates. Colimitation of photosynthesis is a cause of the improvements, as are revisions to photosynthetic parameters and their temperature dependency. Improvements are seen in all regions and seasonally over the course of the year. Similar improvements occur in latent heat flux. Uncertainty in Vcmax produces effects of comparable magnitude as model structural errors, but of offsetting sign. This suggests that model structural errors can be compensated by parameter adjustment, and this may explain the lack of consensus in values for Vcmax used in terrestrial biosphere models. Our analyses show that despite inherent uncertainties global flux fields empirically inferred from FLUXNET data are a valuable tool to guide terrestrial biosphere model development and evaluation.},

(2011) is consistent with FLUXNET, but values for the leaf-level photosynthetic parameterVcmaxthat yield realistic GPP at the canopy-scale are lower than observed in the global synthesis of Kattge et al. (2009), except for tropical broadleaf evergreen trees. We investigate this discrepancy betweenVcmaxand canopy fluxes. A multilayer model with explicit calculation of light absorption and photosynthesis for sunlit and shaded leaves at depths in the canopy gives insight to the scale mismatch between leaf and canopy. We evaluate the model with light-response curves at individual FLUXNET towers and with empirically upscaled annual GPP. Biases in the multilayer canopy with observedVcmaxare similar, or improved, compared with the standard two-leaf canopy and its lowVcmax, though the Amazon is an exception. The difference relates to light absorption by shaded leaves in the two-leaf canopy, and resulting higher photosynthesis when the canopy scaling parameterKn is low, but observationally constrained. Larger Kndecreases shaded leaf photosynthesis and reduces the difference between the two-leaf and multilayer canopies. The low modelVcmaxis diagnosed from nitrogen reduction of GPP in simulations with carbon-nitrogen biogeochemistry. Our results show that the imposed nitrogen reduction compensates for deficiency in the two-leaf canopy that produces high GPP. Leaf trait databases (Vcmax), within-canopy profiles of photosynthetic capacity (Kn), tower fluxes, and empirically upscaled fields provide important complementary information for model evaluation.},

The current tree line position is the result of the past human activity interacting with climatic and topographic conditions. In this study, we investigate how climate, local topographic factors and anthropogenic disturbance currently affect tree line distribution. Location Apennine Mountains, 900 km latitudinal gradient along the Italian Peninsula. Methods Overall, 302 mountain peaks were studied, comprising 3,622 km of measured tree lines. The position of the Fagus sylvatica tree line in all peaks was assessed and correlated with 58 selected variables representing climate, topography and human disturbance. Results The mean tree line elevation was 1,589 m a.s.l., with considerable variability among peaks. Contrary to our expectations, the tree line elevation was lower in the warmer southerly exposed slopes compared to north-facing aspects, where we found the highest tree line (2,141 m a.s.l.). Correlation analysis indicates that both climatic and human density variables are associated with tree line elevation, with the climate having more influence in high elevation mountains, while human impact plays a prominent role in low elevation mountain peaks. Specifically, we found negative correlations between density of the resident population around each peak and tree line elevation at all examined dates (1861, 1921, and 2011), suggesting a pervasive negative impact of human activity on tree lines. As regards climatic variables, tree line elevation showed a stronger negative correlation with winter and spring months temperature than with mean annual temperature. Noteworthy, climatic variables had stronger effect on high elevation peaks ({$>$}1,900 m a.s.l.) compared with low elevation ones ({$<$}1,900 m a.s.l.). Main Conclusion Our data provide evidence that the current position of the F. sylvatica tree line in the Apennines is heavily depressed as a result of a complex interaction between climatic factors and the past human pressure.},

  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation has been shown to disrupt ecosystem processes such as plant-pollinator mutualisms. Consequently, mating patterns in remnant tree populations are expected to shift towards increased inbreeding and reduced pollen diversity, with fitness consequences for future generations. However, mating patterns and phenotypic assessments of open-pollinated progeny have rarely been combined in a single study. Here, we collected seeds from 37 Eucalyptus incrassata trees from contrasting stand densities following recent clearance in a single South Australian population (intact woodland=12.6 trees ha-1; isolated pasture=1.7 trees ha-1; population area=10\,km2). 649 progeny from these trees were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. We estimated genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, indirect contemporary pollen flow and mating patterns for adults older than the clearance events and open-pollinated progeny sired post-clearance. A proxy of early stage progeny viability was assessed in a common garden experiment. Density had no impact on mating patterns, adult and progeny genetic diversity or progeny growth, but was associated with increased mean pollen dispersal. Weak spatial genetic structure among adults suggests high historical gene flow. We observed preliminary evidence for inbreeding depression related to stress caused by fungal infection, but which was not associated with density. Higher observed heterozygosities in adults compared with progeny may relate to weak selection on progeny and lifetime-accumulated mortality of inbred adults. E. incrassata appears to be resistant to the negative mating pattern and fitness changes expected within fragmented landscapes. This pattern is likely explained by strong outcrossing and regular long-distance pollen flow.},

This behaviour may help to maintain a given transmission distance of songs, which are used in territory defence and mate attraction. At the same time, birds forced to sing with higher amplitudes have to bear the increased costs of singing. 4 This suggests that in songbirds the level of environmental noise in a territory will contribute to its quality and thus considerably affect the behavioural ecology of singing males.},

We investigated mating system, pollen dispersal patterns and the level of pollen immigration in a clonal archive of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). The plantation consisted of 114 clones originating from different (often distant) parts of Poland. We sampled 100 seeds in upper and lower crown portions of two ramets, each of five clones (totally 2000 seeds). Using allozyme markers, we estimated the parameters of reproductive system based on neighborhood model approach. We found that the level of self-fertilization was generally low (s=0.059), although statistically significant. The immigration from outside of the neighborhoods (20m radius) was considerable accounting for more than 83\% of successful fertilizations. Despite the high level of distant gene flow, pollen dispersal within neighborhoods was severely restricted to neighboring trees with a mean effective pollen dispersal distance=6.8m (mean physical distance between mothers and potential fathers=13.1m). In addition, mating success of individual males within neighborhoods was moderately influenced by their fecundity and direction of their location relative to mother trees. The mean effective number of outcross males within neighborhoods was low (Ne=6.71), which is about 7.5\% of the mean number of potential males (90). The mating parameters were similar in upper and lower crown levels. The implications of reproductive patterns of clonal archives for ex situ conservation programs are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Trees growing at high altitude or latitude have to be adapted, among others, to the lower temperatures, a shorter vegetation period, heavier snow load, and frost desiccation. Association between molecular genetic markers and climatic variables may provide evidence for the genetic control of climatic adaptation. With increasing genomic resources, several genes with importance to climatic adaptation are identified over a wide range of tree species. Commonly, circadian clock genes are linked to the adaptation to lower temperatures and especially to a shortened vegetation period, as they are regulating metabolic and phenological processes in the day\textendash night shift and seasonal change. Potentially adaptive ``candidate'' genes associated with latitudinal and elevational gradients were identified in several Picea spp. Before molecular markers became available to study climatic adaptation and phenotypic traits measured in natural populations, and/or common garden studies were used to search for their association with climate variables. In Norway spruce, the crown architecture is the most noticeable trait associated with altitude and the related environment. The mountainous narrow-crowned morphotype is characterized by superior resistance to snow breakage in regions with heavy snowfall. In total, the crown shape was assessed in 765 individual trees from mountainous regions in the Thuringian Forest, the Ore Mountains (Saxony), and Harz Mountains (Lower-Saxony/Saxony-Anhalt), and they were genotyped at 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 adaptive trait-related candidate genes. Six SNPs in three genes, APETALA 2-like 3 (AP2L3), GIGANTEA (GI), and mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) were associated with variation in crown shape. GI has previously been identified in angiosperms and gymnosperms to be associated with temperature and growth cessation. Our results showed that crown morphology in Norway spruce is associated with genetic markers which are putatively involved in the complex process of genetic adaptation to climatic conditions at high altitudes.},

  abstract = {Trees growing at high altitude or latitude have to be adapted, among others, to the lower temperatures, a shorter vegetation period, heavier snow load, and frost desiccation. Association between molecular genetic markers and climatic variables may provide evidence for the genetic control of climatic adaptation. With increasing genomic resources, several genes with importance to climatic adaptation are identified over a wide range of tree species. Commonly, circadian clock genes are linked to the adaptation to lower temperatures and especially to a shortened vegetation period, as they are regulating metabolic and phenological processes in the day\textendash night shift and seasonal change. Potentially adaptive ``candidate'' genes associated with latitudinal and elevational gradients were identified in several Picea spp. Before molecular markers became available to study climatic adaptation and phenotypic traits measured in natural populations, and/or common garden studies were used to search for their association with climate variables. In Norway spruce, the crown architecture is the most noticeable trait associated with altitude and the related environment. The mountainous narrow-crowned morphotype is characterized by superior resistance to snow breakage in regions with heavy snowfall. In total, the crown shape was assessed in 765 individual trees from mountainous regions in the Thuringian Forest, the Ore Mountains (Saxony), and Harz Mountains (Lower-Saxony/Saxony-Anhalt), and they were genotyped at 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 adaptive trait-related candidate genes. Six SNPs in three genes, APETALA 2-like 3 (AP2L3), GIGANTEA (GI), and mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) were associated with variation in crown shape. GI has previously been identified in angiosperms and gymnosperms to be associated with temperature and growth cessation. Our results showed that crown morphology in Norway spruce is associated with genetic markers which are putatively involved in the complex process of genetic adaptation to climatic conditions at high altitudes.},

The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission enables significant improvements in providing high spatial and temporal resolution SIF observations, but the short temporal coverage of the data records has limited its applications in long-term studies. This study uses machine learning to reconstruct TROPOMI SIF (RTSIF) over the 2001\textendash 2020 period in clear-sky conditions with high spatio-temporal resolutions (0.05\textdegree{} 8-day). Our machine learning model achieves high accuracies on the training and testing datasets (R2\,=\,0.907, regression slope\,=\,1.001). The RTSIF dataset is validated against TROPOMI SIF and tower-based SIF, and compared with other satellite-derived SIF (GOME-2 SIF and OCO-2 SIF). Comparing RTSIF with Gross Primary Production (GPP) illustrates the potential of RTSIF for estimating gross carbon fluxes. We anticipate that this new dataset will be valuable in assessing long-term terrestrial photosynthesis and constraining the global carbon budget and associated water fluxes.},

When these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

We then applied tests with a quality control system (QCS) developed for the detection, correction and possible replacement of suspicious data.

Surprisingly, none of the three GHG flux rates differed with topographical position. CO2 effluxes covaried with soil pH, soil water content (SWC), available nitrogen and total phosphorus. The CH4 fluxes were best explained by variation in SWC, with soils acting as a sink under drier conditions and as a source under wetter conditions. Unexpectedly, our study areas were generally sinks for N2O and N2O fluxes were partly explained by total phosphorus and available nitrogen concentrations. This first study describing the spatial variation of soil fluxes of the three main GHGs measured simultaneously in forests of the Guiana Shield lays the foundation for specific studies of the processes underlying the observed patterns.},

Recommended practices in conservation genetics must be evaluated in regards to these differing consequences of an increase of effective population size.

  abstract = {In the UK the now widespread non-native grey squirrel produces problems for the forestry industry through damage from bark stripping and threatens the survival of native species most notably the red squirrel which, mainly as a result of resource competition and transmission of infection, has suffered dramatic declines. Reducing grey squirrel numbers is essential to decrease this species' ecological and environmental impact. Using an individual-based model operating in a fine scaled landscape of well-mixed woodlands with reliable seed production we develop novel effort-based mechanisms explicitly representing the probabilistic interaction of individual squirrels with either traps or bait hoppers to capture the density-dependant efficiency of culling and fertility control respectively. We also integrate a habitat-based resistance to inter-patch movement to describe more realistically the source-sink dynamics in regional scale populations. We use this new framework to compare the relative effort of population management at a landscape scale using both culling and fertility control, alone and combined as part of an integrated, sequential, approach. We also exploit our spatially-explicit framework to demonstrate how we might identify neighbourhoods within our study area where management may be easier (quicker and cheaper) or more difficult (sub-populations resistant to management), to enable the prediction of an optimal spatial and temporal deployment of management effort. Our results agree with previous studies on the relative efficiency of culling in eradicating squirrels, as well as on the substantial ``costs'' of this approach. Despite an assumption of lower deployment costs, our findings suggest that, at least for the initial squirrel densities assumed, fertility control alone is unlikely to achieve rapid enough reduction to prove a viable cost-effective alternative to completely replace culling. However, when applied to the low density populations following short-term culling, eradication could be achieved within the same timescales as continuous culling alone but with substantially lower costs.},

  abstract = {Process-Based Models (PBMs) can successfully predict the impact of environmental factors (temperature, light, CO2, water and nutrients) on crop growth and yield. These models are used widely for yield prediction and optimization of water and nutrient supplies. Nevertheless, PBMs do not consider plant architecture as a determinant of yield, thus they often lack the flexibility to follow plant plasticity. Leaf area index (LAI), flower and fruit abortion are usually not predicted very well, because PBMs operate at the level of plant compartment (e.g. all leaves together) and unit area of crop instead of the phytomers where the feedback between plant growth and plant architecture operates. Functional Structural Plant Models (FSPMs) use the architecture as the support of functioning, integrate properly the action of the environmental conditions at the phytomer level that gives the plant its full plasticity: feedback between biomass production and biomass partitioning for both development (functioning of meristems) and growth (sink strength and variation, allometry of organs). These kinds of models suffer from the drawbacks that data acquisition is very heavy and model parameter estimations rely on numeric simulation that demands thousands of iterations as no analytical solution is available. Coupling PBM and FSPM, as done in the GreenLab model, is an important step to improve yield prediction not only with respect to its quantity but also to its quality (number and size of organs, branching pattern in ornamental plants). In the GreenLab model biomass production depends on PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and LAI, a common pool of biomass is assumed and partitioning of biomass among organs is based on their relative sink strength. Plant architecture is simulated dynamically and the organ functioning is modified continuously during growth according to various environmental conditions. Such mathematical models could provide better yield prediction, as crop production depends on the functioning of the plant architecture, and parameter identification is more accurate with inverse methods. Some examples addressing the above-mentioned issues are presented in this paper using the GreenLab model.},

  abstract = {Statistical gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation from remote sensing observations has mostly been attempted on the basis of multispectral observations. To make full use of the information contained in vegetation spectra, however, hyperspectral observations should be used in combination with appropriate multivariate methods. Nevertheless, only very few previous studies attempted to estimate GPP directly from hyperspectral observations and did so on the basis of reflectance, with only a limited number of temporally discontinuous observations. In this study, we used long-term, continuous, half-hourly hyperspectral observations covering the visible and near-infrared spectral range to estimate GPP directly from upwelling irradiance using partial least square (PLS) regression in a rice paddy. To gain a better understanding of processes underlying the PLS estimation, we used extensive complementary field observations to run process-based simulations using the SCOPE model. We then applied PLS regression to the simulated hyperspectral data in the same way as for the observations and disentangled contributions related to relevant physiological processes, namely sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and xanthophyll cycle-related spectral changes (XC). We found that upwelling hyperspectral irradiance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range predicted GPP better than reflectance. Furthermore, PLS-based GPP estimates outperformed both far-red SIF and widely used vegetation index-based methods. However, the most relevant information for the observation-based PLS-models was not clearly related to XC or SIF as the near-infrared spectral range showed comparable performance. Also, the simple average of upwelling irradiance over the 850\textendash 900\,nm range outperformed the other non-multivariate approaches, including far-red SIF. These results held for the evaluation in terms of the seasonal variation of GPP, while there was apparently a small contribution of SIF and XC for the diurnal variation. The simulation-based analysis showed that SIF and XC contributed useful information to both GPP and photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) estimates at both seasonal and diurnal time scales. The strongest unique contribution from either SIF or XC, however, was to the diurnal variation of GPP and XC showed considerably better performance than SIF. We did not find improvements when combining the spectral regions of XC (500\textendash 570\,nm) and SIF (650\textendash 800\,nm) to estimate GPP. While SIF showed improvements when combined with the remaining spectral information excluding XC, this was not the case for XC. Our approach combines the strengths of process-based modeling with multivariate statistical analysis to improve our understanding of the usable information content in vegetation spectra and is highly relevant for further developing suitable methods for GPP estimation at large scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We propose new metrics to assist global sensitivity analysis, GSA, of hydrological and Earth systems. Our approach allows assessing the impact of uncertain parameters on main features of the probability density function, pdf, of a target model output, \emph{y}. These include the expected value of \emph{y}, the spread around the mean and the degree of symmetry and tailedness of the pdf of \emph{y}. Since reliable assessment of higher-order statistical moments can be computationally demanding, we couple our GSA approach with a surrogate model, approximating the full model response at a reduced computational cost. Here, we consider the generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE), other model reduction techniques being fully compatible with our theoretical framework. We demonstrate our approach through three test cases, including an analytical benchmark, a simplified scenario mimicking pumping in a coastal aquifer and a laboratory-scale conservative transport experiment. Our results allow ascertaining which parameters can impact some moments of the model output pdf while being uninfluential to others. We also investigate the error associated with the evaluation of our sensitivity metrics by replacing the original system model through a gPCE. Our results indicate that the construction of a surrogate model with increasing level of accuracy might be required depending on the statistical moment considered in the GSA. The approach is fully compatible with (and can assist the development of) analysis techniques employed in the context of reduction of model complexity, model calibration, design of experiment, uncertainty quantification and risk assessment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Half-hourly time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) measured through the micro-meteorological eddy covariance (EC) technique are noisy and show a high percentage of missing data. By using EC measurements that are part of the FLUXNET2015 dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multiple imputation (MI) strategy based on an efficient computational strategy introduced in Honaker and King (2010), combining the classic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a bootstrap approach, in order to take draws from a suitable approximation of posterior distribution of model parameters. Armed with these instruments, we are able to introduce three new multiple imputation models, characterized by an increasing level of complexity, and built on top of multivariate normality assumption: 1) MLR, which imputes EC missing values using a static multiple linear regression of observed values of suitable input variables; 2) ADL, which enriches with dynamic properties the static specification of MLR, by considering an autoregressive distributed lag specification; 3) PADL, which adds further complexity by embedding the ADL model in a panel-data perspective. Under several artificial gap scenarios, we show that PADL has a better ability in modeling the complex dynamics of ecosystem fluxes and reconstructing missing data points, thus providing unbiased imputations and preserving the original sampling distribution. The added flexibility arising from the time series cross section structure of PADL warrants improved performances, outperforming those of other imputation methods, as well as of the marginal distribution sampling algorithm (MDS), a widely used gapfilling approach introduced by Reichstein et al. (2005), especially in the case of nighttime flux data. It is expected that the strategy proposed in this paper will become useful in creating multiple imputations for a variety of EC datasets, providing valid inferences for a broad range of scientific estimands (such as annual budgets).},

  abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

Light at night has been associated with health problems in humans as a consequence of altered biological rhythms. Effects on wild animals have been less investigated, but light at night has often been assumed to affect seasonal cycles of urban dwellers. Using light loggers attached to free-living European blackbirds (Turdus merula), we first measured light intensity at night which forest and city birds are subjected to in the wild. Then we used these measurements to test for the effect of light at night on timing of reproductive physiology. Captive city and forest blackbirds were exposed to either dark nights or very low light intensities at night (0.3 lux). Birds exposed to light at night developed their reproductive system up to one month earlier, and also moulted earlier, than birds kept under dark nights. Furthermore, city birds responded differently than forest individuals to the light at night treatment, suggesting that urbanization can alter the physiological phenotype of songbirds. Our results emphasize the impact of human-induced lighting on the ecology of millions of animals living in cities and call for an understanding of the fitness consequences of light pollution.},

Progress in documenting the ecological effects of sensory pollutants is weakened by sparse knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects. This severely limits our capacity to devise mitigation measures. Here, we integrate knowledge of animal sensory ecology, physiology and life history to articulate three perceptual mechanisms\textemdash masking, distracting and misleading\textemdash that clearly explain how and why anthropogenic sensory pollutants impact organisms. We then link these three mechanisms to ecological consequences and discuss their implications for conservation. We argue that this framework can reveal the presence of `sensory danger zones', hotspots of conservation concern where sensory pollutants overlap in space and time with an organism's activity, and foster development of strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of sensory pollutants. Future research that applies this framework will provide critical insight to preserve the natural sensory world.},

In this paper, we propose to use multi-head deep attention networks to fill gaps in Micro-Meteorological Data. This methodology couples large-scale information extraction with modeling capabilities that cannot be achieved by interpolation-like techniques. Unlike Bidirectional RNNs, our architecture is not recurrent, it is simple to tune and our data efficiency is higher. We apply our architecture to real-life data and clearly show its applicability in agriculture, furthermore, we show that it could be used to solve related problems such as filling gaps in cyclic-multivariate-time-series.},

The dominant source of this bias is still under debate. Using validated datasets and both coupled and off-line modeling, we find that the CUS summertime warm bias is driven by the incorrect partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) into its canopy transpiration and soil evaporation components. Specifically, CMIP6 ESMs do not effectively use available rootzone soil moisture for summertime transpiration and instead rely excessively on shallow soil and canopy-intercepted water storage to supply ET. As such, expected summertime precipitation deficits in CUS induce a negative ET bias into CMIP6 ESMs and a corresponding positive temperature bias via local land-atmosphere coupling. This tendency potentially biases CMIP6 projections of regional water stress and summertime air temperature variability under elevated CO2 conditions.},

  abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the `folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {$>$}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

  abstract = {This book presents a comprehensive treatment of the state space approach to time series analysis. The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as being made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance elements, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible. Part I presents a full treatment of the construction and analysis of linear Gaussian state space models. The methods are based on the Kalman filter and are appropriate for a wide range of problems in practical time series analysis. The analysis can be carried out from both classical and Bayesian perspectives. Part I then presents illustrations to real series and exercises are provided for a selection of chapters. Part II discusses approximate and exact approaches for handling broad classes of non-Gaussian and nonlinear state space models. Approximate methods include the extended Kalman filter and the more recently developed unscented Kalman filter. The book shows that exact treatments become feasible when simulation-based methods such as importance sampling and particle filtering are adopted. Bayesian treatments based on simulation methods are also explored.}

Despite the increasing interest among scientists in fields such as ecology, astronomy, health care, and land-use planning, light pollution lacks a current quantification of its magnitude on a global scale. To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new high-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements. This atlas shows that more than 80\% of the world and more than 99\% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60\% of Europeans and nearly 80\% of North Americans. Moreover, 23\% of the world's land surfaces between 75\textdegree N and 60\textdegree S, 88\% of Europe, and almost half of the United States experience light-polluted nights. The world atlas of zenith artificial night sky brightness is modelled with VIIRS DNB data and calibrated with more than 35,000 observations.

Gaps in the long term measurements of evaporation and sensible heat flux must be filled before these data can be used for hydrological and meteorological applications. We adapted methods of gap filling for NEE (net ecosystem exchange of carbon) to energy fluxes and applied them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux eddy covariance databases. The average data coverage for the sites selected was 69\% and 75\% for latent heat ({$\lambda$}E) and sensible heat (H).

The difference between annual {$\lambda$}E filled by MDV and {$\lambda$}E filled by LookUp ranged from -120 to 210MJm-2 per year, i.e. -48 to +86mm per year, or -13 to +39\% of the annual sum. For annual sums of H differences between -140 and +140MJm-2 per year or -12 to +19\% of the annual sum were found.},

  abstract = {Heightened awareness of global change issues within both science and political communities has increased interest in using the global network of eddy covariance flux towers to more fully understand the impacts of natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the global carbon balance. Comparisons of net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) responses are being made among biome types, phenology patterns, and stress conditions. The comparisons are usually performed on annual sums of FNEE; however, the average data coverage during a year is only 65\%. Therefore, robust and consistent gap filling methods are required. We review several methods of gap filling and apply them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux databases. The methods are based on mean diurnal variation (MDV), look-up tables (LookUp), and nonlinear regressions (Regr.), and the impact of different gap filling methods on the annual sum of FNEE is investigated. The difference between annual FNEE filled by MDV compared to FNEE filled by Regr. ranged from -45 to +200gCm-2 per year (MDV-Regr.). Comparing LookUp and Regr. methods resulted in a difference (LookUp-Regr.) ranging from -30 to +150gCm-2 per year. We also investigated the impact of replacing measurements at night, when turbulent mixing is insufficient. The nighttime correction for low friction velocities (u{${_\ast}$}) shifted annual FNEE on average by +77gCm-2 per year, but in certain cases as much as +185gCm-2 per year. Our results emphasize the need to standardize gap filling-methods for improving the comparability of flux data products from regional and global flux networks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Nowcasts, or near-real-time (NRT) forecasts, of soil moisture based on the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission could provide substantial value for a range of applications including hazards monitoring and agricultural planning. To provide such a NRT forecast with high fidelity, we enhanced a time series deep learning architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM), with a novel data integration (DI) kernel to assimilate the most recent SMAP observations as soon as they become available. The kernel is adaptive in that it can accommodate irregular observational schedules. Testing over the CONUS, this NRT forecast product showcases predictions with unprecedented accuracy when evaluated against subsequent SMAP retrievals. It showed smaller error than NRT forecasts reported in the literature, especially at longer forecast latency. The comparative advantage was due to LSTM's structural improvements, as well as its ability to utilize more input variables and more training data. The DI-LSTM was compared to the original LSTM model that runs without data integration, referred to as the projection model here. We found that the DI procedure removed the autocorrelated effects of forcing errors and errors due to processes not represented in the inputs, for example, irrigation and floodplain/lake inundation, as well as mismatches due to unseen forcing conditions. The effects of this purely data-driven DI kernel are discussed for the first time in the geosciences. Furthermore, this work presents an upper-bound estimate for the random component of the SMAP retrieval error.},

  abstract = {Core Ideas The numerical solution of Richards' equation remains challenging. Space/time discretization affects both computational effort and accuracy. Adaption of space and time discretizations produces benefits. Dissemination of codes and improved documentation are needed. Recent reformulation of one-dimensional Richards' equation shows promise. The flow of water in partially saturated porous media is of importance in fields such as hydrology, agriculture, environment and waste management. It is also one of the most complex flows in nature. The Richards' equation describes the flow of water in an unsaturated porous medium due to the actions of gravity and capillarity neglecting the flow of the non-wetting phase, usually air. Analytical solutions of Richards' equation exist only for simplified cases, so most practical situations require a numerical solution in one- two- or three-dimensions, depending on the problem and complexity of the flow situation. Despite the fact that the first reasonably complete conservative numerical solution method was published in the early 1990s, the numerical solution of the Richards' equation remains computationally expensive and in certain circumstances, unreliable. A universally robust and accurate solution methodology has not yet been identified that is applicable across the range of soils, initial and boundary conditions found in practice. Existing solution codes have been modified over years to attempt to increase robustness. Despite theoretical results on the existence of solutions given sufficiently regular data and constitutive relations, our numerical methods often fail to demonstrate reliable convergence behavior in practice, especially for higher-order methods. Because of robustness, the lack of higher-order accuracy and computational expense, alternative solution approaches or methods are needed. There is also a need for better documentation of improved solution methodologies and benchmark test problems to facilitate consistent advances and avoid re-inventing of the wheel.},

Changes of environmental conditions and forest stand structures brought along by silvicultural practices concerning artificial and natural regeneration, regulation of species mixtures, thinning, and harvesting operations have a strong influence on evolutionary forces like drift, mating systems, gene flow and selection. The observation of long-term effects of silvicultural regimes on genetic structures and adaptive potentials is hampered by long rotation cycles of most forest trees. Artificial regeneration is the most obvious silvicultural practice resulting in possibly drastic changes of genetic structures not only in planted forests, but, in later generations, due to gene flow also in neighbouring forests. However, natural regeneration is no safeguard against unintentional changes of genetic structures by forest managers. Loss of genetic variation and adaptive potentials may be expected if reproduction-effective population sizes are seriously reduced or, mainly in the case of rare and scattered species, if the gene flow through pollen is severely restricted by low population densities. Harvesting and thinning operations may have serious impacts on adaptive and economically important traits due to selection in favor of particular phenotypes. Target diameter felling serves as an example to describe possible consequences for genetic structures on subsequent generations in more detail. Consequences of silvicultural management practices on genetic structures of tree populations are most severe and detrimental in tropical forestry.},

  abstract = {Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests \textendash{} starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem \textendash{} can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.},

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.},

This novel acoustic background may be detrimental for many species, particularly birds [1]. We evaluated conservation concerns that noise limits bird distributions and reduces nesting success via a natural experiment to isolate the effects of noise from confounding stimuli and to control for the effect of noise on observer detection biases [5]. We show that noise alone reduces nesting species richness and leads to different avian communities. Contrary to expectations, noise indirectly facilitates reproductive success of individuals nesting in noisy areas as a result of the disruption of predator-prey interactions. The higher reproductive success for birds within noisy habitats may be a previously unrecognized factor contributing to the success of urban-adapted species and the loss of birds less tolerant of noise. Additionally, our findings suggest that noise can have cascading consequences for communities through altered species interactions. Given that noise pollution is becoming ubiquitous throughout much of the world, knowledge of species-specific responses to noise and the cumulative effects of these novel acoustics may be~crucial to understanding and managing human-altered landscapes.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the net CO2 flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance technique have the potential to underpin our interpretation of regional CO2 source\textendash sink patterns, CO2 flux responses to forcings, and predictions of the future terrestrial C balance. Information contained in FLUXNET eddy covariance data has multiple uses for the development and application of global carbon models, including evaluation/validation, calibration, process parameterization, and data assimilation. This paper reviews examples of these uses, compares global estimates of the dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and suggests ways of improving the utility of such data for global carbon modelling. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) predicted by different terrestrial biosphere models compares favourably with FLUXNET observations at diurnal and seasonal timescales. However, complete model validation, particularly over the full annual cycle, requires information on the balance between assimilation and decomposition processes, information not readily available for most FLUXNET sites. Site history, when known, can greatly help constrain the model-data comparison. Flux measurements made over four vegetation types were used to calibrate the land-surface scheme of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model, significantly improving simulated climate and demonstrating the utility of diurnal FLUXNET data for climate modelling. Land-surface temperatures in many regions cool due to higher canopy conductances and latent heat fluxes, and the spatial distribution of CO2 uptake provides a significant additional constraint on the realism of simulated surface fluxes. FLUXNET data are used to calibrate a global production efficiency model (PEM). This model is forced by satellite-measured absorbed radiation and suggests that global net primary production (NPP) increased 6.2\% over 1982\textendash 1999. Good agreement is found between global trends in NPP estimated by the PEM and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), and between the DGVM and estimates of global NEE derived from a global inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements. Combining the PEM, DGVM, and inversion results suggests that CO2 fertilization is playing a major role in current increases in NPP, with lesser impacts from increasing N deposition and growing season length. Both the PEM and the inversion identify the Amazon basin as a key region for the current net terrestrial CO2 uptake (i.e. 33\% of global NEE), as well as its interannual variability. The inversion's global NEE estimate of -1.2 Pg [C] yr-1 for 1982\textendash 1995 is compatible with the PEM- and DGVM-predicted trends in NPP. There is, thus, a convergence in understanding derived from process-based models, remote-sensing-based observations, and inversion of atmospheric data. Future advances in field measurement techniques, including eddy covariance (particularly concerning the problem of night-time fluxes in dense canopies and of advection or flow distortion over complex terrain), will result in improved constraints on land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes and the rigorous attribution of mechanisms to the current terrestrial net CO2 uptake and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Global ecosystem models play a fundamental role in linking information derived from FLUXNET measurements to atmospheric CO2 variability. A number of recommendations concerning FLUXNET data are made, including a request for more comprehensive site data (particularly historical information), more measurements in undisturbed ecosystems, and the systematic provision of error estimates. The greatest value of current FLUXNET data for global carbon cycle modelling is in evaluating process representations, rather than in providing an unbiased estimate of net CO2 exchange.},

  abstract = {Safeguarding sustainability of forest ecosystems with their habitat variability and all their functions is of highest priority. Therefore, the long-term adaptability of forest ecosystems to a changing environment must be secured, e.g., through sustainable forest management. High adaptability is based on biological variation starting at the genetic level. Thus, the ultimate goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to halt the ongoing erosion of biological variation is of utmost importance for forest ecosystem functioning and sustainability. Monitoring of biological diversity over time is needed to detect changes that threaten these biological resources. Genetic variation, as an integral part of biological diversity, needs special attention, and its monitoring can ensure its effective conservation. We compare forest genetic monitoring to other biodiversity monitoring concepts. Forest genetic monitoring (FGM) enables early detection of potentially harmful changes of forest adaptability before these appear at higher biodiversity levels (e.g., species or ecosystem diversity) and can improve the sustainability of applied forest management practices and direct further research. Theoretical genetic monitoring concepts developed up to now need to be evaluated before being implemented on a national and international scale. This article provides an overview of FGM concepts and definitions, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and provides a flow chart of the steps needed for the optimization and implementation of FGM. FGM is an important module of biodiversity monitoring, and we define an effective FGM scheme as consisting of an assessment of a forest population's capacity to survive, reproduce, and persist under rapid environmental changes on a long-term scale.},

CNPs make accurate predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to complex functions and large datasets.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Herein, a recently developed methodology, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), is presented and applied to the challenge of soil moisture prediction. Support Vector Machines are derived from statistical learning theory and can be used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training that uses past data, hence providing a statistically sound approach to solving inverse problems. The principal strength of SVMs lies in the fact that they employ Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) instead of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The SVMs formulate a quadratic optimization problem that ensures a global optimum, which makes them superior to traditional learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The resulting model is sparse and not characterized by the ``curse of dimensionality.'' Soil moisture distribution and variation is helpful in predicting and understanding various hydrologic processes, including weather changes, energy and moisture fluxes, drought, irrigation scheduling, and rainfall/runoff generation. Soil moisture and meteorological data are used to generate SVM predictions for four and seven days ahead. Predictions show good agreement with actual soil moisture measurements. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with predictions obtained from ANN models and show that SVM models performed better for soil moisture forecasting than ANN models.},

  abstract = {With the development of machine learning, surrogate modeling, sensitivity analysis and optimization techniques in the recent years, the number of model evaluation required by parameter calibration and uncertainty quantification can be significantly reduced, making it possible to automatic calibrate the very expensive dynamic models like Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and Earth System Models (ESM). To develop a prototype system of ESM automatic calibration, we use LOVECLIM, a kind of Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) which has very simplified physics to make it cheap to run, as an example model to calibrate. The LOVECLIM model is global coupled model with atmosphere-land surface-ocean processes. In this research, we simultaneously optimize global mean temperature together with water cycle variables, including evapotranspiration and precipitation over land or sea, and runoff. First, the most important parameters were screened out with sensitivity analysis (SA). Three SA methods MARS, RF, and sparse PCE-based Sobol' method were used to evaluate a pool of 25 adjustable parameters chosen from land, atmosphere, and ocean components of LOVECLIM and their results were intercompared to ensure robustness of the results. Then a surrogate modeling-based mutli-objective optimization method was applied to optimize the selected important parameters of LOVECLIM. The result indicated that all of the involved objectives can be simultaneously improved. We have also found that the evapotranspiration and runoff processes have significant influence to not only the global temperature but also many other atmospheric variables, indicating that sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration can help to diagnose the model structure deficiency.},

Those metrics turn out to be useful at different stage of the development process, e.g. comparing the performance of two different models or analysing the behaviour of the same model by tuning different parameters.

To handle this challenging task, we introduce DILATE (DIstortion Loss including shApe and TimE), a new objective function for training deep neural networks. DILATE aims at accurately predicting sudden changes, and explicitly incorporates two terms supporting precise shape and temporal change detection. We introduce a differentiable loss function suitable for training deep neural nets, and provide a custom back-prop implementation for speeding up optimization. We also introduce a variant of DILATE, which provides a smooth generalization of temporally-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experiments carried out on various non-stationary datasets reveal the very good behaviour of DILATE compared to models trained with the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and also to DTW and variants. DILATE is also agnostic to the choice of the model, and we highlight its benefit for training fully connected networks as well as specialized recurrent architectures, showing its capacity to improve over state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting approaches.},

  abstract = {Motivation Trait data are fundamental to the quantitative description of plant form and function. Although root traits capture key dimensions related to plant responses to changing environmental conditions and effects on ecosystem processes, they have rarely been included in large-scale comparative studies and global models. For instance, root traits remain absent from nearly all studies that define the global spectrum of plant form and function. Thus, to overcome conceptual and methodological roadblocks preventing a widespread integration of root trait data into large-scale analyses we created the Global Root Trait (GRooT) Database. GRooT provides ready-to-use data by combining the expertise of root ecologists with data mobilization and curation. Specifically, we (a) determined a set of core root traits relevant to the description of plant form and function based on an assessment by experts, (b) maximized species coverage through data standardization within and among traits, and (c) implemented data quality checks. Main types of variables contained GRooT contains 114,222 trait records on 38 continuous root traits.

Time period and grain Data were recorded between 1911 and 2019. Major taxa and level of measurement GRooT includes root trait data for which taxonomic information is available. Trait records vary in their taxonomic resolution, with subspecies or varieties being the highest and genera the lowest taxonomic resolution available. It contains information for 184 subspecies or varieties, 6,214 species, 1,967 genera and 254 families. Owing to variation in data sources, trait records in the database include both individual observations and mean values. Software format GRooT includes two csv files. A GitHub repository contains the csv files and a script in R to query the database.},

  abstract = {1 Throughout much of Britain, Ireland and north Italy, red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris L.) have been replaced by alien grey squirrels (S. carolinensis Gmelin) introduced from North America. We have studied squirrels in two mixed woodlands in north Italy and two conifer forests in north England. In each country, one site was occupied by red squirrels and one site by both species. 2 We have previously considered interference competition and exploitation competition for food and space between red and grey squirrels and have showed that grey squirrels caused reduced body growth in juvenile and subadult red squirrels, and compete for tree seeds cached by adult red squirrels in spring. Here we report on the effects of grey squirrels on three fitness components in red squirrels that have consequence at the population level: fecundity, residency and recruitment. 3 Litter production peaked in the spring and summer, but fewer females bred in the summer with grey squirrels present. In addition, fewer individual red squirrel females produced two litters per year in the sites with grey squirrels. Moreover, red squirrel recruitment rate and, in the mixed broadleaf sites, red squirrel juvenile residency, decreased with increasing grey squirrel density. 4 Fecundity of individual female red squirrels was lower in red\textendash grey than in red-only sites because they had a lower body mass in sites with grey squirrels. 5 Overall, there was no significant effect of grey squirrels on residency of adult red squirrels or on population turnover rate. However, the presence of grey squirrels resulted in a reduction in red squirrel fitness which was evident by lower population summer breeding and a lower recruitment. Over time, this will result in a decline in population size and eventually population extinction.},

  abstract = {Genetic diversity, population differentiation, and temporal variation in outcrossing rates were examined for Pithecellobium elegans, a Neotropical rain forest canopy tree. Several forest fragments and a large reserve (1500 ha) were compared for several population genetic parameters. For eight populations sampled on the Atlantic coastal plain of Costa Rica, allozyme heterozygosity (0.13), polymorphism (35\%), and effective number of alleles (1.24) were similar to values reported for other tropical tree species that occur at similar densities of less than one individual per hectare. These measures of genetic variation were lowest in populations of the smallest size, farthest from the reserve, and more isolated from other populations. Differentiation among samples collected in small forest fragments and the reserve population accounted for 10\% of the total genetic variation observed. There was a positive relationship between the level of differentiation of populations from the reserve population and their distance from the reserve. Though predominantly an annually flowering species, the number of trees in flower at any one time varied from 80\% of observed trees to only 6\%. Outcrossing rates did not differ for two episodes in which the proportions of flowering trees were 33\% and 80\%. But periods of low density of flowering adults resulted in poor seed crops or failure to set fruit for many individuals. Population size at many sites will be effectively decreased because of the variation in flowering. Fragmentation of what was once a large, continuous forested area is resulting in genetic erosion of small, isolated populations of Pithecellobium elegans.},

  abstract = {The natural greenhouse effect of the Earth is strongly influenced by the radiative effects of water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere, which control the energy absorbed from the sun, and that lost through thermal emission to space. Any perturbations to the climate balance, for example through so-called `radiative forcing' due to increasing CO2 amounts, variations in solar constant, or other causes, can be amplified by the feedback processes that involve water in its various phases. The radiative cooling of the Earth in the absence of clouds has recently been shown to be dominated by emission from upper-tropospheric water vapour, in the far infrared portion of the spectrum, and this is illustrated: observations of this radiative flux, and of the distribution of water vapour in the upper troposphere, are urgently needed. The role of clouds is discussed, and it is noted that their response to global warming is not presently unambiguously determined with available models, due to the complexity of competing processes: again, as in the cloud-free case, more accurate global observations are needed. The paper is illustrated by data from satellite experiments, most notably the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment sponsored by NASA.},

  abstract = {Treelines are temperature sensitive transition zones that are expected to respond to climate warming by advancing beyond their current position. Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52\% of sites with only 1\% reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods\textemdash random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression\textemdash as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10\textendash fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

Various observational estimates are available for the individual budget terms; however, these typically show inconsistencies when combined in a budget. In this work, a Conserving Land\textendash Atmosphere Synthesis Suite (CLASS) of estimates of simultaneously balanced surface water and energy budget components is developed. Individual CLASS variable datasets, where possible, 1) combine a range of existing variable product estimates, and hence overcome the limitations of estimates from a single source; 2) are observationally constrained with in situ measurements; 3) have uncertainty estimates that are consistent with their agreement with in situ observations; and 4) are consistent with each other by being able to solve the water and energy budgets simultaneously. First, available datasets of a budget variable are merged by implementing a weighting method that accounts both for the ability of datasets to match in situ measurements and the error covariance between datasets. Then, the budget terms are adjusted by applying an objective variational data assimilation technique (DAT) that enforces the simultaneous closure of the surface water and energy budgets linked through the equivalence of evapotranspiration and latent heat. Comparing component estimates before and after applying the DAT against in situ measurements of energy fluxes and streamflow showed that modified estimates agree better with in situ observations across various metrics, but also revealed some inconsistencies between water budget terms in June over the higher latitudes.

Forty-seven species of Coprinus and 19 additional species from the families Coprinaceae, Strophariaceae, Bolbitiaceae, Agaricaceae, Podaxaceae, and Montagneaceae were studied. A total of 1360 sites was sequenced across seven divergent domains and intervening sequences. A total of 302 phylogenetically informative characters was found. Ninety-eight percent of the average divergence between taxa was located within the divergent domains, with domains D2 and D8 being most divergent and domains D7 and D10 the least divergent. An empirical test of phylogenetic signal among divergent domains also showed that domains D2 and D3 had the lowest levels of homoplasy. Two equally most parsimonious trees were resolved using Wagner parsimony. A character-state weighted analysis produced 12 equally most parsimonious trees similar to those generated by Wagner parsimony. Phylogenetic analyses employing topological constraints suggest that none of the major taxonomic systems proposed for subgeneric classification is able to completely reflect phylogenetic relationships in Coprinus. A strict consensus integration of the two Wagner trees demonstrates the problematic nature of choosing outgroups within dark-spored mushrooms. The genus Coprinus is found to be polyphyletic and is separated into three distinct clades. Most Coprinus taxa belong to the first two clades, which together form a larger monophyletic group with Lacrymaria and Psathyrella in basal positions. A third clade contains members of Coprinus section Comati as well as the genus Leucocoprinus, Podaxis pistillaris, Montagnea arenaria, and Agaricus pocillator. This third clade is separated from the other species of Coprinus by members of the families Strophariaceae and Bolbitiaceae and the genus Panaeolus.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of evapotranspiration is a key issue in many fields like hydrology, ecology, and agriculture. There exist different ways, including physical-based and data-driven approaches, to estimate evapotranspiration. Here, the physical-based model (the surface energy balance system, SEBS), data-driven models (using three machine learning techniques, deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and symbolic regression (SR)), and hybrid model were compared using the FLUXNET2015 dataset. More importantly, different search strategies were investigated to optimize the network architecture and to explore the maximum accuracy of data-driven models. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was introduced to quantify the contributions of input features to evapotranspiration estimation. The results show that there is a large error in the SEBS model with RMSE of 121~W~m-2, while the data-driven models acquire the best evapotranspiration estimation with RMSE of 32\textendash 53~W~m-2. The hybrid approach, whose RMSE is 60~W~m-2, improves the SEBS model but still underperforms data-driven models. The complexity of data-driven models influences the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimations. By optimizing the network architecture, DNN and RF obtain results with similar precision. But the performance of SR, which generates a simple algebraic formula for evapotranspiration estimation, is significantly degraded. SHAP reveals that all models regard net radiation as the most crucial feature. The SEBS and hybrid models attach much importance to temperature and humidity. Three data-driven models learn the different relationships between input features and evapotranspiration. The DNN-based model is likely to learn a relatively correct relationship among the data-driven models because it has a similar feature importances pattern with physical-based and hybrid models.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a ubiquitous problem in evaluating long-term experimental measurements, such as those associated with the FluxNet project, due to the equipment failures, system maintenance, power-failure, and lightning strikes among other things. To estimate annual values of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H), such gaps in the measured data must be filled or imputed. So far, no standardized method has been accepted and the imputation methods used are largely dependent on the researchers' choice. Here, we used multiple imputation (MI) to gap-fill the missing data for annual estimations of NEE, LE and H at three flux sites associated with the FluxNet effort. MI is a Monte Carlo technique in which the missing values are replaced by several simulated values. Each data set imputed is a complete one where the observed values are the same as those in the original data set; only the missing values are different. Thus, the normal statistical analysis (e.g. annual total calculation) can be applied to each data set separately. The results of each analysis can be recombined into one summary. We applied the MI method to eddy covariance measurements collected from Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) site (a deciduous forest), Duke site (a coniferous forest) and Niwot site (a subalpine forest). Results showed that annual estimations of NEE, LE and H by MI were comparable to other imputation methods but MI was much easier to apply because of readily available software and standard algorithms. Besides the normal statistical analyses, MI also provided confidence intervals for each estimated parameter. This confidence interval is most useful when assessing energy, water, and carbon balance closures at a given tower site. Significant differences in annual NEE, LE and H were found among years at the three AmeriFlux sites. NEE at the Niwot Ridge site was lower and LE and H were higher than at the other two sites. With the available software and realistic gap-filling capability, MI has the potential to become a standardized method to gap-fill eddy covariance flux data for annual estimations and to improve the analysis of uncertainties associated with annual estimations of NEE, LE and H from regional and global flux networks.},

Previous studies found that noise exposure decreases habitat quality and reproductive success for some species. However, few studies have linked the reduction in perceived habitat quality due to noise exposure to effects on avian settlement patterns and reproductive success. Here, we experimentally investigate the impacts of noise pollution during settlement on adult settlement patterns and subsequent reproductive success in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We found that tree swallow adults preferentially settled in quieter nest boxes (a 1 dBA increase delayed settlement date by 1.4 and 3.5 days for males and females, respectively). Egg-laying date (a proxy of female quality) also increased by 3.8 days for every 1 dBA increase in noise. These results suggest that lower-quality tree swallows settled in noise; however, more research is needed to confirm this result, as we did not measure adult quality directly. Our results also suggest a negative relationship between noise exposure during settlement and reproductive success, which cannot be explained by differences in adult quality alone. When controlling for egg-laying date, females that settled in noise-exposed nests laid 0.58 fewer eggs than controls. Finally, maternal noise exposure, but not egg-laying date, was negatively related to nestling body condition. These results are concerning, as they highlight multiple pathways through which traffic noise may result in negative impacts at the local, population level for free-living birds.},

  abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).},

Early studies of these exchanges were confined to brief field campaigns in carefully controlled conditions followed by months of data analysis. Current practice is to run tower-based eddy covariance systems continuously over several years due to the need for continuous monitoring as part of a global effort to develop local-, regional-, continental- and global-scale budgets of carbon, water and energy. Efficient methods of processing the increased quantities of data are needed to maximise the time available for analysis and interpretation. Standardised methods are needed to remove differences in data processing as possible contributors to observed spatial variability. Furthermore, public availability of these data sets assists with undertaking global research efforts. The OzFlux data path has been developed (i) to provide a standard set of quality control and post-processing tools across the network, thereby facilitating inter-site integration and spatial comparisons; (ii) to increase the time available to researchers for analysis and interpretation by reducing the time spent collecting and processing data; (iii) to propagate both data and metadata to the final product; and (iv) to facilitate the use of the OzFlux data by adopting a standard file format and making the data available from web-based portals. Discovery of the OzFlux data set is facilitated through incorporation in FLUXNET data syntheses and the publication of collection metadata via the RIF-CS format. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to describe the data sets, along with their quality control and post-processing, for the other papers of this Special Issue. The second is to provide an example of one solution to the data collection and curation challenges that are encountered by similar flux tower networks worldwide.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} FLUXNET comprises globally distributed eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere\textendash atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}\&gt;0.94 at 1\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70\&thinsp;\% of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008\textendash 2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130\&thinsp;PgC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}{$\sim$}0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}{$\sim$}0.6). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}\&gt;0.92). Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}=0.87 for 2001\textendash 2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for CO\textsubscript{2} fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This paper introduces and validates a machine learning approach dedicated to the upscaling of observations from the current global network of eddy covariance towers (FLUXNET). We present a new model TRee Induction ALgorithm (TRIAL) that performs hierarchical stratification of the data set into units where particular multiple regressions for a target variable hold. We propose an ensemble approach (Evolving tRees with RandOm gRowth, ERROR) where the base learning algorithm is perturbed in order to gain a diverse sequence of different model trees which evolves over time. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We evaluate the efficiency of the model tree ensemble (MTE) approach using an artificial data set derived from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) biosphere model. We aim at reproducing global monthly gross primary production as simulated by LPJmL from 1998\textendash 2005 using only locations and months where high quality FLUXNET data exist for the training of the model trees. The model trees are trained with the LPJmL land cover and meteorological input data, climate data, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation simulated by LPJmL. Given that we know the "true result" in the form of global LPJmL simulations we can effectively study the performance of the MTE upscaling and associated problems of extrapolation capacity. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We show that MTE is able to explain 92\% of the variability of the global LPJmL GPP simulations. The mean spatial pattern and the seasonal variability of GPP that constitute the largest sources of variance are very well reproduced (96\% and 94\% of variance explained respectively) while the monthly interannual anomalies which occupy much less variance are less well matched (41\% of variance explained). We demonstrate the substantially improved accuracy of MTE over individual model trees in particular for the monthly anomalies and for situations of extrapolation. We estimate that roughly one fifth of the domain is subject to extrapolation while MTE is still able to reproduce 73\% of the LPJmL GPP variability here. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This paper presents for the first time a benchmark for a global FLUXNET upscaling approach that will be employed in future studies. Although the real world FLUXNET upscaling is more complicated than for a noise free and reduced complexity biosphere model as presented here, our results show that an empirical upscaling from the current FLUXNET network with MTE is feasible and able to extract global patterns of carbon flux variability.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Alternate recursive relationships have been developed to propagate a state estimate and a square root error covariance instead. Although equivalent algebraically to the conventional approach, the square root filters exhibit improved numerical characteristics, particularly in ill-conditioned problems. In this paper, current techniques in square root filtering are surveyed and related by applying a duality association. Four efficient square root implementations are suggested, and compared with three common conventional implementations in terms of computational complexity and precision. The square root computational burden should not exceed the conventional by more than 50 percent in most practical problems. An examination of numerical conditioning predicts that the square root approach can yield twice the effective precision of the conventional filter in ill-conditioned problems. This prediction is verified in two examples. The excellent numerical characteristics and reasonable computation requirements of the square root approach make it a viable alternative to the conventional filter in many applications, particularly when computer word length is limited, or the estimation problem is badly conditioned.},

Based on a large-scale inventory ({$\approx$}100\,km2) in which all individuals of a naturally scattered forest tree (Sorbus domestica) were mapped, we inferred current gene flow by pollen using genetic paternity analysis. We detected an extensive network of effective pollen transfer. Although short pollen flow distances were most abundant, 10\% of the assigned pollen donors were more than 2\,km away from their female mating partners, and 1.8\% were even at a distance of 12\textendash 16\,km. This latter pollen flow shows that current long-distance gene flow over a fragmented landscape clearly occurs. Pollen dispersal was well described by a fat-tailed inverse curve. Using parentage analysis of established trees, maternally inherited chloroplast markers and diameter at breast height measurements as an indicator of individual tree age, we were able to infer regular seed dispersal distances over several hundred metres up to more than 10\,km. We conclude that in temperate, insect-pollinated and animal-dispersed tree species such as S. domestica, fragmented subpopulations are functionally connected by gene flow through both pollen and seed.},

  abstract = {Plant traits \textendash{} the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs \textendash{} determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation \textendash{} but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

Each function models the distribution of the output given an input, conditioned on the context. NPs have the benefit of fitting observed data efficiently with linear complexity in the number of context input-output pairs, and can learn a wide family of conditional distributions; they learn predictive distributions conditioned on context sets of arbitrary size. Nonetheless, we show that NPs suffer a fundamental drawback of underfitting, giving inaccurate predictions at the inputs of the observed data they condition on. We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled.},

  abstract = {Methane flux (FCH4) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have increased over the past decade. FCH4 measurements commonly include data gaps, as is the case with CO2 and energy fluxes. However, gap-filling FCH4 data are more challenging than other fluxes due to its unique characteristics including multidriver dependency, variabilities across multiple timescales, nonstationarity, spatial heterogeneity of flux footprints, and lagged influence of biophysical drivers. Some researchers have applied a marginal distribution sampling (MDS) algorithm, a standard gap-filling method for other fluxes, to FCH4 datasets, and others have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to resolve the challenging characteristics of FCH4. However, there is still no consensus regarding FCH4 gap-filling methods due to limited comparative research. We are not aware of the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms beyond ANN to FCH4 datasets. Here, we compare the performance of MDS and three ML algorithms (ANN, random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]) using multiple combinations of ancillary variables. In addition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) as an input to the algorithms to address multidriver dependency of FCH4 and reduce the internal complexity of the algorithmic structures. We applied this approach to five benchmark FCH4 datasets from both natural and managed systems located in temperate and tropical wetlands and rice paddies. Results indicate that PCA improved the performance of MDS compared to traditional inputs. ML algorithms performed better when using all available biophysical variables compared to using PCA-derived inputs. Overall, RF was found to outperform other techniques for all sites. We found gap-filling uncertainty is much larger than measurement uncertainty in accumulated CH4 budget. Therefore, the approach used for FCH4 gap filling can have important implications for characterizing annual ecosystem-scale methane budgets, the accuracy of which is important for evaluating natural and managed systems and their interactions with global change processes.},

The constraints that modulate the evaporation from plant leaves (or transpiration, Et) are particularly complex, yet are often assumed to interact linearly in global models due to our limited knowledge based on local studies. Here, we train deep learning algorithms using eddy covariance and sap flow data together with satellite observations, aiming to model transpiration stress (St), i.e., the reduction of Et from its theoretical maximum. Then, we embed the new St formulation within a process-based model of E to yield a global hybrid E model. In this hybrid~model, the St formulation is bidirectionally coupled to the host model at daily timescales. Comparisons against in situ data and satellite-based proxies demonstrate an enhanced ability to estimate St and E globally. The proposed framework may be extended to improve the estimation of E in Earth System Models and enhance our understanding of this crucial climatic variable.},

Trees can be absent from the treeline due to disturbances or biotic interactions. The actual local edge of tree distribution, the delineation of the realized niche, is driven by stochastic effects.

In fact, each of the Earth's subsystems \textendash{} i.e., the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere \textendash{} can be analyzed from a multitude of data streams. However, since it is very hard to jointly interpret multiple monitoring data streams in parallel, one often aims for some summarizing indicator. Climate indices, for example, summarize the state of atmospheric circulation in a region. Although such approaches are also used in other fields of science, they are rarely used to describe land surface dynamics. Here, we propose a robust method to create global indicators for the terrestrial biosphere using principal component analysis based on a high-dimensional set of relevant global data streams. The concept was tested using 12 explanatory variables representing the biophysical state of ecosystems and land\textendash atmosphere fluxes of water, energy, and carbon fluxes. We find that three indicators account for 82\&thinsp;\% of the variance of the selected biosphere variables in space and time across the globe. While the first indicator summarizes productivity patterns, the second indicator summarizes variables representing water and energy availability. The third indicator represents mostly changes in surface albedo. Anomalies in the indicators clearly identify extreme events, such as the Amazon droughts (2005 and 2010) and the Russian heat wave (2010). The anomalies also allow us to interpret the impacts of these events. The indicators can also be used to detect and quantify changes in seasonal dynamics. Here we report, for instance, increasing seasonal amplitudes of productivity in agricultural areas and arctic regions. We assume that this generic approach has great potential for the analysis of land surface dynamics from observational or model data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The neural-network-learned hydrological responses of evapotranspiration and grid cell runoff to antecedent soil moisture states are qualitatively consistent with our understanding and theory. The simulated contributions of groundwater, soil moisture, and snowpack variability to TWS variations are plausible and within the ranges of traditional GHMs. H2M identifies a somewhat stronger role of soil moisture for TWS variations in transitional and tropical regions compared to GHMs.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}With the findings and analysis, we conclude that H2M provides a new data-driven perspective on modeling the global hydrological cycle and physical responses with machine-learned parameters that is consistent with and complementary to existing global modeling frameworks.

The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate that under a ``big data'' paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Their biota are often characterized by narrow distributions and are particularly susceptible to biological invasions and climate change. To date, the global richness pattern of islands is only poorly documented and factors causing differences in species numbers remain controversial. Here, we present the first global analysis of 488 island and 970 mainland floras. We test the relationship between island characteristics (area, isolation, topography, climate and geology) and species richness using traditional and spatial models. Area is the strongest determinant of island species numbers (R2 = 0.66) but a weaker predictor for mainlands (R2 = 0.25). Multivariate analyses reveal that all investigated variables significantly contribute to insular species richness with area being the strongest followed by isolation, temperature and precipitation with about equally strong effects. Elevation and island geology show relatively weak yet significant effects. Together these variables account for 85\% of the global variation in species richness.},

  abstract = {Abstract To improve the quality of scalar-flux measurements, the two-point covariance between the vertical velocity {\~w} and a scalar {\~s}, separated in space both horizontally and vertically, is studied. The measurements of such two-point covariances between vertical velocity and temperature with horizontal and vertical separations show good agreement with a symmetric turbulence model when the displacement is horizontal. However, a similar model does not work for vertical displacements because up\textendash down asymmetry exists; that is, there is a lack of reflection symmetry of the covariance function. The second-order equation for conservation of two-point covariance of {\~w} and {\~s} reveals the reason for this up\textendash down asymmetry and determines its character. On the basis of our measurements, the ``loss of flux'' for a given lateral displacement decreases with increasing height of the sensors. For example, at a height of z = 10 m with a sensor displacement of D = 0.2 m, less than 1\% of the flux is lost, whereas at z = 1 m the same instrument configuration gives rise to a loss of 13\%. Also, when the displacement is vertical, the ``flux loss'' decreases with height if the displacement is kept constant, but in this case the asymmetry causes the loss to be much smaller if the scalar sensor is positioned below the anemometer: if the mean height is 1 m and the displacement 0.2 m, the loss is 18\% with the scalar sensor over the anemometer and only 2\% if the instrument positions are interchanged. The authors conclude that when measuring close to the ground, the separation should be vertical with the scalar sensor below the anemometer. In this way a symmetric (omnidirectional) configuration with a minimum of flux loss is obtained.},

Correlations between male song traits (such as repertoire size or singing rate) and components of fitness reveal that important information, perhaps about overall male quality, is available for listeners. To determine whether birds use that information, however, will require researchers to manipulate song traits independently of male quality. Having then determined more rigorously the ``current utility'' of song, we will more clearly be able to infer how selection has shaped particular song traits. We envision progress in understanding the function(s) of bird song if investigators 1) thoroughly describe natural events, 2) use lucidly stated, multiple working hypotheses, 3) realize the potential differences in song function among divergent taxonomic units, 4) transcend correlational studies by doing ingenious manipulative experiments, and 5) reason carefully when developing scenarios of evolutionary origin.},

The results of gap-filling simulations showed that the variability of NEE estimates made with moving window and parameter prediction methods were closer to that of observed NEE, whereas the traditional method had overall lower variability. The average root mean square errors (RMSE) of predictions was lower for moving window and parameter prediction (3.38 and 3.22, respectively), versus that of the traditional method (3.42) over one year, including both daytime and nighttime data across all gap sizes. The variances associated with moving window and parameter prediction methods were 52\% and 57\%, respectively, of the observed variance, versus that of the traditional (51\%), while the average of first-order autocorrelation coefficients was 0.76 for each method compared to 0.58 for observed.

So far the assimilation of eddy covariance measurements from flux-tower sites has been conducted mostly for individual sites ("single-site" optimization). Here we develop a variational data assimilation system to optimize 21 parameters of the ORCHIDEE biogeochemical model, using net CO\textsubscript{2} flux (NEE) and latent heat flux (LE) measurements from 12 temperate deciduous broadleaf forest sites. We assess the potential of the model to simulate, with a single set of inverted parameters, the carbon and water fluxes at these 12 sites. We compare the fluxes obtained from this "multi-site" (MS) optimization to those of the prior model, and of the "single-site" (SS) optimizations. The model-data fit analysis shows that the MS approach decreases the daily root-mean-square difference (RMS) to observed data by 22\%, which is close to the SS optimizations (25\% on average). We also show that the MS approach distinctively improves the simulation of the ecosystem respiration (\emph{R}\textsubscript{eco}), and to a lesser extent the gross primary productivity (GPP), although we only assimilated net CO\textsubscript{2} flux. A process-oriented parameter analysis indicates that the MS inversion system finds a unique combination of parameters which is not the simple average of the different SS sets of parameters. Finally, in an attempt to validate the optimized model against independent data, we observe that global-scale simulations with MS optimized parameters show an enhanced phase agreement between modeled leaf area index (LAI) and satellite-based observations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} All eddy-covariance flux measurements are associated with random uncertainties which are a combination of sampling error due to natural variability in turbulence and sensor noise. The former is the principal error for systems where the signal-to-noise ratio of the analyser is high, as is usually the case when measuring fluxes of heat, CO\textsubscript{2} or H\textsubscript{2}O. Where signal is limited, which is often the case for measurements of other trace gases and aerosols, instrument uncertainties dominate. Here, we are applying a consistent approach based on auto- and cross-covariance functions to quantify the total random flux error and the random error due to instrument noise separately. As with previous approaches, the random error quantification assumes that the time lag between wind and concentration measurement is known. However, if combined with commonly used automated methods that identify the individual time lag by looking for the maximum in the cross-covariance function of the two entities, analyser noise additionally leads to a systematic bias in the fluxes. Combining data sets from several analysers and using simulations, we show that the method of time-lag determination becomes increasingly important as the magnitude of the instrument error approaches that of the sampling error. The flux bias can be particularly significant for disjunct data, whereas using a prescribed time lag eliminates these effects (provided the time lag does not fluctuate unduly over time). We also demonstrate that when sampling at higher elevations, where low frequency turbulence dominates and covariance peaks are broader, both the probability and magnitude of bias are magnified. We show that the statistical significance of noisy flux data can be increased (limit of detection can be decreased) by appropriate averaging of individual fluxes, but only if systematic biases are avoided by using a prescribed time lag. Finally, we make recommendations for the analysis and reporting of data with low signal-to-noise and their associated errors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Eddy covariance data are increasingly used to estimate parameters of ecosystem models. For proper maximum likelihood parameter estimates the error structure in the observed data has to be fully characterized. In this study we propose a method to characterize the random error of the eddy covariance flux data, and analyse error distribution, standard deviation, cross- and autocorrelation of CO\textsubscript{2} and H\textsubscript{2}O flux errors at four different European eddy covariance flux sites. Moreover, we examine how the treatment of those errors and additional systematic errors influence statistical estimates of parameters and their associated uncertainties with three models of increasing complexity \textendash{} a hyperbolic light response curve, a light response curve coupled to water fluxes and the SVAT scheme BETHY. In agreement with previous studies we find that the error standard deviation scales with the flux magnitude. The previously found strongly leptokurtic error distribution is revealed to be largely due to a superposition of almost Gaussian distributions with standard deviations varying by flux magnitude. The crosscorrelations of CO\textsubscript{2} and H\textsubscript{2}O fluxes were in all cases negligible (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} below 0.2), while the autocorrelation is usually below 0.6 at a lag of 0.5 h and decays rapidly at larger time lags. This implies that in these cases the weighted least squares criterion yields maximum likelihood estimates. To study the influence of the observation errors on model parameter estimates we used synthetic datasets, based on observations of two different sites. We first fitted the respective models to observations and then added the random error estimates described above and the systematic error, respectively, to the model output. This strategy enables us to compare the estimated parameters with true parameters. We illustrate that the correct implementation of the random error standard deviation scaling with flux magnitude significantly reduces the parameter uncertainty and often yields parameter retrievals that are closer to the true value, than by using ordinary least squares. The systematic error leads to systematically biased parameter estimates, but its impact varies by parameter. The parameter uncertainty slightly increases, but the true parameter is not within the uncertainty range of the estimate. This means that the uncertainty is underestimated with current approaches that neglect selective systematic errors in flux data. Hence, we conclude that potential systematic errors in flux data need to be addressed more thoroughly in data assimilation approaches since otherwise uncertainties will be vastly underestimated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we focus on the invasive wetland grass Phalaris arundinacea L. and document the evolutionary consequences that resulted from multiple and uncontrolled introductions into North America of genetic material native to different European regions. Continental-scale genetic variation occurring in reed canarygrass' European range has been reshuffled and recombined within North American introduced populations, giving rise to a number of novel genotypes. This process alleviated genetic bottlenecks throughout reed canarygrass' introduced range, including in peripheral populations, where depletion of genetic diversity is expected and is observed in the native range. Moreover, reed canarygrass had higher genetic diversity and heritable phenotypic variation in its invasive range relative to its native range. The resulting high evolutionary potential of invasive populations allowed for rapid selection of genotypes with higher vegetative colonization ability and phenotypic plasticity. Our results show that repeated introductions of a single species may inadvertently create harmful invaders with high adaptive potential. Such invasive species may be able to evolve in response to changing climate, allowing them to have increasing impact on native communities and ecosystems in the future. More generally, multiple immigration events may thus trigger future adaptation and geographic spread of a species population by preventing genetic bottlenecks and generating genetic novelties through recombination.},

This paper addresses the issue of flux underestimation due to this separation. A model is developed in the framework of Monin-Obukhov similarity for the spatial covariance of vertical velocity and air temperature in the unstable surface layer. It allows the underestimation of sensible heat flux to be assessed using information on separation orientation relative to wind direction, atmospheric stability, measurement height, and separation distance. The coefficient in the model is evaluated with observations made over a potato field and a clover field. The principles established here should also be applicable to fluxes of scalars other than sensible heat.},

Human interference on global genetic resources results from the impact of different activities: (i) breeding and selection, (ii) seed transfer, (iii) plant population management activities, (iv) alteration of the environment. Expected genetic consequences of these activities were reviewed and revised according to the recent literature. Research on domestication in crop plants reveals that drastic selection can still retain a significant level of genetic diversity including diversity of some genes involved in the selected traits. More important than the impact of breeding and selection in trees, the impact of seed transfer on the whole resource is complex, depending on the origin and genetic diversity of the transplanted material, as well as on the environmental conditions and genetic diversity of the local population in the destination site. Among silvicultural practices, the regeneration phase has a great potential for reducing genetic diversity, but various regeneration practices may result in high genetic diversity. Other treatments, like thinning, may also interfere with the demographic parameters which shape genetic diversity. Thus, different silvicultural systems will have different impacts on the genetic resources of target species but no simple ranking can be made in that respect. Attention should also be given to the genetic resources of non-target species which may be severely affected. Finally, a major impact is suspected from modifications in the biotic and abiotic environment: this should be further investigated. Monitoring the genetic resources globally requires the development of criteria and indicators: some recent research orientations serving this objective were listed.},

The relationship between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) the empirical relationship derived provides representative estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity and its effects on atmospheric CO2. The predicted seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity is very sensitive to the assumed respiration vs temperature relationship. 5. For biomes in areas where soil temperatures are low, soil respiration rate is relatively more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Nevertheless, more information is required before any predictions can be made about changes in soil carbon pools in response to future temperature changes.}

  abstract = {The main theme of this thesis is analyzing and modeling large spatio-temporal datasets, such as global temperature measurements. The task is typically to extract relevant structure and features for predicting or studying the system. This can be a challenging problem because simple models are often not able to capture the complex structure suffiently well, and more sophisticated models can be computationally too expensive in practice. This thesis presents a novel spatio-temporal model which extends factor analysis by setting Gaussian process priors over the spatial and temporal components. In contrast to factor analysis, the presented model is capable of modeling complex spatial and temporal structure. Compared to standard Gaussian process regression over the spatio-temporal domain, the presented model gains substantial computational savings by operating only in the spatial or temporal domain at a time. Thus, it is feasible to model larger spatio-temporal datasets than with standard Gaussian process regression. The new model combines the modeling assumptions of several traditional techniques used for analyzing spatially and temporally distributed data: kriging is used for modeling spatial dependencies; empirical orthogonal functions reduce the dimensionality of the problem; and temporal smoothing finds relevant features from time series. The model is applied to reconstruct missing values in a historical sea surface temperature dataset. The results are promising and suggest that the proposed model may outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.},

The model is used to compute the reconstructions of the global sea surface temperatures from a historical dataset. The results suggest that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.},

  abstract = {While large-scale terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) information is essential for our understanding of the Earth's water and energy cycles, substantial differences exist in current global ET products due partly to uncertainties in soil- and vegetation-related parameters and/or precipitation forcing. Here a calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) model, driven purely by routine meteorological forcing (air and dew-point temperature, wind speed, and net radiation), mainly from ERA5, was employed to estimate global ET rates during 1982\textendash 2016. Modeled ET agrees favorably with (a) monthly eddy-covariance measurements of 129 global FLUXNET sites, and; (b) water-balance-derived ET of 52 basins at the multiyear mean and annual scales. Additional evaluations demonstrate that the CR is very competitive, in comparison with other 12 widely used global ET products. The 35-years mean global land ET rate from the CR is 500 {$\pm$} 6 mm yr-1 (72.3 {$\pm$} 0.9 \texttimes{} 103 km3 yr-1) with more than 70\% of the land area exhibiting increasing annual ET rates over the study period. Globally, CR ET significantly increased at a rate of 0.31 mm yr-1 during 1982\textendash 2016, suggesting a 2.2\% increase in global land ET over last 35 years. Model inter-comparisons indicate that global annual CR ET values and their trend are close to the median of not only the 12 ET products chosen but also that of 20 CMIP6 models. Since this calibration-free CR model requires no precipitation (except in sea-shore deserts for a subsequent ET correction), vegetation or soil data, it could be incorporated into complex hydrological and/or climate models, thereby facilitating large-scale hydrological and climate simulations.},

  abstract = {We study the contribution of typically uncertain subsurface flow parameters to gravity changes that can be recorded during pumping tests in unconfined aquifers. We do so in the framework of a Global Sensitivity Analysis and quantify the effects of uncertainty of such parameters on the first four statistical moments of the probability distribution of gravimetric variations induced by the operation of the well. System parameters are grouped into two main categories, respectively, governing groundwater flow in the unsaturated and saturated portions of the domain. We ground our work on the three-dimensional analytical model proposed by Mishra and Neuman (2011), which fully takes into account the richness of the physical process taking place across the unsaturated and saturated zones and storage effects in a finite radius pumping well. The relative influence of model parameter uncertainties on drawdown, moisture content, and gravity changes are quantified through (a) the Sobol' indices, derived from a classical decomposition of variance and (b) recently developed indices quantifying the relative contribution of each uncertain model parameter to the (ensemble) mean, skewness, and kurtosis of the model output. Our results document (i) the importance of the effects of the parameters governing the unsaturated flow dynamics on the mean and variance of local drawdown and gravity changes; (ii) the marked sensitivity (as expressed in terms of the statistical moments analyzed) of gravity changes to the employed water retention curve model parameter, specific yield, and storage, and (iii) the influential role of hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated and saturated zones to the skewness and kurtosis of gravimetric variation distributions. The observed temporal dynamics of the strength of the relative contribution of system parameters to gravimetric variations suggest that gravity data have a clear potential to provide useful information for estimating the key hydraulic parameters of the system.},

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

These models discern often nonlinear and interacting relationships between measured sound levels and nonacoustic environmental summaries extracted from nationwide geospatial data layers. Tens of potential explanatory factors were examined including climate, topography, human activity, and time of day and year. Mapping sound levels at landscape scales and diagnostic tools, like partial dependence functions, can reveal the effects of influential factors on measured sound levels.

  abstract = {We review 15 techniques for estimating missing values of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in eddy covariance time series and evaluate their performance for different artificial gap scenarios based on a set of 10 benchmark datasets from six forested sites in Europe. The goal of gap filling is the reproduction of the NEE time series and hence this present work focuses on estimating missing NEE values, not on editing or the removal of suspect values in these time series due to systematic errors in the measurements (e.g., nighttime flux, advection). The gap filling was examined by generating 50 secondary datasets with artificial gaps (ranging in length from single half-hours to 12 consecutive days) for each benchmark dataset and evaluating the performance with a variety of statistical metrics. The performance of the gap filling varied among sites and depended on the level of aggregation (native half-hourly time step versus daily), long gaps were more difficult to fill than short gaps, and differences among the techniques were more pronounced during the day than at night. The non-linear regression techniques (NLRs), the look-up table (LUT), marginal distribution sampling (MDS), and the semi-parametric model (SPM) generally showed good overall performance. The artificial neural network based techniques (ANNs) were generally, if only slightly, superior to the other techniques. The simple interpolation technique of mean diurnal variation (MDV) showed a moderate but consistent performance. Several sophisticated techniques, the dual unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the multiple imputation method (MIM), the terrestrial biosphere model (BETHY), but also one of the ANNs and one of the NLRs showed high biases which resulted in a low reliability of the annual sums, indicating that additional development might be needed. An uncertainty analysis comparing the estimated random error in the 10 benchmark datasets with the artificial gap residuals suggested that the techniques are already at or very close to the noise limit of the measurements. Based on the techniques and site data examined here, the effect of gap filling on the annual sums of NEE is modest, with most techniques falling within a range of {$\pm$}25gCm-2year-1.},

  abstract = {An eddy covariance system is described which has been developed jointly at a number of European laboratories and which was used widely in HAPEX-Sahel. The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a three-axis sonic anemometer and an IR gas analyser which is used in a closed-path mode, i.e. air is brought to the optical bench by being ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide, and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer. The instruments are described and details of their operation and connection are presented. The system has relatively low power consumption and can operate from appropriate solar cells or rechargeable batteries. Calibration of the gas analyser needs to be performed typically every 2 or 3 days, and, given that the system requires minimal maintenance and is weather insensitive, it can be operated for the routine collection of surface flux data for extended periods. There are a number of corrections which have to be applied in any eddy covariance system and we describe the system of transfer functions which define our system. Some representative results showing the potential of the system are presented.},

Inheritance analyses in seedlings and corresponding megagametophytes of gymnosperms were used as a direct experimental verification of microsatellite null alleles in single-tree progeny.

  abstract = {Abstract: Organisms must adapt to the temporal characteristics of their surroundings to successfully survive and reproduce. Variation in the daily light cycle, for example, acts through endocrine and neurobiological mechanisms to control several downstream physiological and behavioral processes. Interruptions in normal circadian light cycles and the resulting disruption of normal melatonin rhythms cause widespread disruptive effects involving multiple body systems, the results of which can have serious medical consequences for individuals, as well as large-scale ecological implications for populations. With the invention of electrical lights about a century ago, the temporal organization of the environment has been drastically altered for many species, including humans. In addition to the incidental exposure to light at night through light pollution, humans also engage in increasing amounts of shift-work, resulting in repeated and often long-term circadian disruption. The increasing prevalence of exposure to light at night has significant social, ecological, behavioral, and health consequences that are only now becoming apparent. This review addresses the complicated web of potential behavioral and physiological consequences resulting from exposure to light at night, as well as the large-scale medical and ecological implications that may result.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Our objectives were to identify factors related to temporal variation of soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux in a boreal pine forest and to evaluate simple predictive models of temporal variation of soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux. Soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux was measured with a portable chamber in a Finnish Scots pine forest for three years, with a fourth year for model evaluation. Plot averages for soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux ranged from 0.04 to 0.90 g CO\textsubscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2} h\textsuperscript{-1} during the snow-free period, i.e. May\textendash October, and from 0.04 to 0.13 g CO\textsubscript{2} m\textsuperscript{-2} h\textsuperscript{-1} in winter. Soil temperature was a good predictor of soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux. A quadratic model of ln-transformed efflux explained 76\textendash 82 \% of the variation over the snow-free period. {$<$}br{$><$}/br{$>$} The results revealed an effect of season: at a given temperature of the organic layer, soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux was higher later in the snow-free period (in August and September) than in spring and early summer (in May and June). Regression coefficients for temperature (approximations of a \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} value) of month-specific models decreased with increasing average soil temperatures. Efflux in July, the month of peak photosynthesis, showed no clear response to temperature or moisture. Inclusion of a seasonality index, degree days, improved the accuracy of temperature response models to predict efflux for the fourth year of measurements, which was not used in building of regression models. During peak efflux from mid-July to late-August, efflux was underestimated with the models that included degree days as well as with the models that did not. The strong influence of the flux of photosynthates belowground and the importance of root respiration could explain the relative temperature insensitivity observed in July and together with seasonality of growth of root and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi could explain partial failure of models to predict magnitude of efflux in the peak season from mid-July to August. {$<$}br{$><$}/br{$>$} The effect of moisture early in the season was confounded by simultaneous advancement of the growing season and increase in temperature. In a dry year, however, the effect of drought was evident as soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux was some 30 \% smaller in September than in the previous wet year. Soil temperature was a good overall predictor of soil CO\textsubscript{2} efflux, possibly partly because its apparent effect was strengthened by many environmental factors and ecosystem processes that varied in concert with its variation. However, the consistent underestimation by the predictive models for the peak season corroborates recent findings concerning the importance of seasonal changes in carbon inputs to processes producing CO\textsubscript{2} in soil.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The systematic errors in EC calculation propagate into the energy balance residual and can be larger than the residual itself: for example, omitting spectral corrections overestimates the residual by 13\% or 18\% on average, depending on the analyser.},

The future direction of evolutionary change is intrinsically unpredictable, because the unit of study (the population) cannot be isolated from changes in its environment. In contrast, the physical sciences and most of Biology have been able to achieve the goal of prediction by studying systems that generally can be understood in terms of their internal properties. Thus, a particular type of cell or organism studied today is expected to be much the same when studied by subsequent generations of biologists. However, this expectation is lost when we are asked to consider populations and communities over even moderate periods of time: changes on the time scale of tens of years are commonplace, often dramatic, and often caused by unpredictable events external to the study unit. Short-term changes are primarily numerical, but evolutionary changes, both adaptive (e.g., Reznick et al., 1997) and random (e.g., due to a population bottleneck), can accumulate rapidly. The stochastic models of ecology and population genetics include unpredictable environmental effects, allowing us to make probabilistic predictions that can be quite precise when we consider averages over large numbers of populations, large numbers of genes, or long periods of time.},

Here we present a global, long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained with in-situ measurements, SoMo.ml. We train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to extrapolate daily soil moisture dynamics in space and in time, based on in-situ data collected from more than 1,000 stations across the globe. SoMo.ml provides multi-layer soil moisture data (0\textendash 10\,cm, 10\textendash 30\,cm, and 30\textendash 50\,cm) at 0.25\textdegree{} spatial and daily temporal resolution over the period 2000\textendash 2019. The performance of the resulting dataset is evaluated through cross validation and inter-comparison with existing soil moisture datasets. SoMo.ml performs especially well in terms of temporal dynamics, making it particularly useful for applications requiring time-varying soil moisture, such as anomaly detection and memory analyses. SoMo.ml complements the existing suite of modelled and satellite-based datasets given its distinct derivation, to support large-scale hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses.},

ML can learn the relationship between input and target, e.g. meteorological variables and in-situ soil moisture, and then estimate soil moisture across space and time, independently of prior physics-based knowledge. Here we develop a high-resolution (0.1\textdegree ) daily soil moisture dataset in Europe (SoMo.ml-EU) using Long Short-Term Memory trained with in-situ measurements. The resulting dataset covers three vertical layers and the period 2003\textendash 2020. Compared to its previous version with a lower spatial resolution (0.25\textdegree ), it shows a closer agreement with independent in-situ data in terms of temporal variation, demonstrating the enhanced usefulness of in-situ observations when processed jointly with high-resolution meteorological data. Regional comparison with other gridded datasets also demonstrates the ability of SoMo.ml-EU in describing the variability of soil moisture, including drought conditions. As a result, our new dataset will benefit regional studies requiring high-resolution observation-based soil moisture, such as hydrological and agricultural analyses.},

We sampled 23 stands that ranged in size from 1 to {$>$}500 trees isolated by 250\textendash 3000\,m from the nearest other stand. Six polymorphic allozyme loci from four enzyme systems were used to genotype approximately 10\,000 embryos from 104 families. We detected no allele frequency heterogeneity in the pollen pool among stands or families ({$\Phi$}FT=-0.025). Overall, estimates of outcrossing were high (tm=94\% and mean ts=91\%) but significantly different from unity. Bi-parental inbreeding (tm\textendash ts=3.2\%) was low but significantly different from zero. Allozyme-based outcrossing estimates did not differ significantly among three stand-size classes (SSCs): small ({$<$}10 trees), medium (10\textendash 100 trees) and large ({$\geq$}100 trees). The number of effective pollen donors was high in all SSCs, but was significantly lower in small stands (Nep=62.5) than in medium-sized and large stands (both Nep=143). The primary selfing rate was significantly higher in medium stands than in large stands. We found no significant difference in genetic diversity measures in the filial (seed) population among SSCs. Overall, these results indicate that white spruce stands in this fragmented landscape are resistant to genetic diversity losses, primarily through high pollen-mediated gene-flow and early selection against inbred embryos. We discuss the importance of using seed data, in conjunction with genetic data, to evaluate the impacts of fragmentation on natural populations.},

We examined the relationship between microbial activity and water potential in a silt loam soil during four successive drying and rewetting cycles. Microbial activity was inferred from the rate of CO2 accumulating in a sealed flask containing the soil sample and the CO2 respired was measured using gas chromatography. Thermocouple hygrometry was used to monitor the water potential by burying a thermocouple in the soil sample in the flask. Initial treatment by drying on pressure plates brought samples of the test soil to six different water potentials in the range -0.005 to -1.5MPa. Water potential and soil respiration were simultaneously measured while these six soil samples slowly dried by evaporation and were remoistened four times. The results were consistent with a log-linear relationship between water potential and microbial activity as long as activity was not limited by substrate availability. This relationship appeared to hold for the range of water potentials from -0.01 to -8.5 MPa. Even at -0.01 MPa (wet soil) a decrease in water potential from -0.01 to -0.02 MPa caused a 10\% decrease in microbial activity. Rewetting the soil caused a large and rapid increase in the respiration rate. There was up to a 40-fold increase in microbial activity for a short period when the change in water potential following rewetting was greater than 5 MPa. Differences in microbial activity between the wetter and drier soil treatments following rewetting to the original water potentials are discussed in terms of the availability of energy substrate.},

However, direct measurement of global terrestrial ET is not feasible. Here, we first reviewed the basic theory and state-of-the-art approaches for estimating global terrestrial ET, including remote-sensing-based physical models, machine-learning algorithms and land surface models (LSMs). We then utilized 4 remote-sensing-based physical models, 2 machine-learning algorithms and 14 LSMs to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in global terrestrial ET. The results showed that the ensemble means of annual global terrestrial ET estimated by these three categories of approaches agreed well, with values ranging from 589.6\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (6.56\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{4}\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{3}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}) to 617.1\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (6.87\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{4}\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{3}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}). For the period from 1982 to 2011, both the ensembles of remote-sensing-based physical models and machine-learning algorithms suggested increasing trends in global terrestrial ET (0.62\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-2} with a significance level of \emph{p}\&lt;0.05 and 0.38\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-2} with a significance level of \emph{p}\&lt;0.05, respectively). In contrast, the ensemble mean of the LSMs showed no statistically significant change (0.23\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-2}, \emph{p}\&gt;0.05), although many of the individual LSMs reproduced an increasing trend. Nevertheless, all 20 models used in this study showed that anthropogenic Earth greening had a positive role in increasing terrestrial ET. The concurrent small interannual variability, i.e., relative stability, found in all estimates of global terrestrial ET, suggests that a potential planetary boundary exists in regulating global terrestrial ET, with the value of this boundary being around 600\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}. Uncertainties among approaches were identified in specific regions, particularly in the Amazon Basin and arid/semiarid regions. Improvements in parameterizing water stress and canopy dynamics, the utilization of new available satellite retrievals and deep-learning methods, and model\textendash data fusion will advance our predictive understanding of global terrestrial ET.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Empirical modeling approaches are frequently used to upscale local eddy covariance observations of carbon, water, and energy fluxes to regional and global scales. The predictive capacity of such models largely depends on the data used for parameterization and identification of input-output relationships, while prediction for conditions outside the training domain is generally uncertain. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used for the prediction of gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) on local and European scales with the aim to assess the portion of uncertainties in extrapolation due to sample selection. ANNs were found to be a useful tool for GPP and LE prediction, in particular for extrapolation in time (mean absolute error MAE for GPP between 0.53 and 1.56 gC m-2 d-1). Extrapolation in space in similar climatic and vegetation conditions also gave good results (GPP MAE 0.7\textendash 1.41 gC m-2 d-1), while extrapolation in areas with different seasonal cycles and controlling factors (e.g., the tropical regions) showed noticeably higher errors (GPP MAE 0.8\textendash 2.09 gC m-2 d-1). The distribution and the number of sites used for ANN training had a remarkable effect on prediction uncertainty in both, regional GPP and LE budgets and their interannual variability. Results obtained show that for ANN upscaling for continents with relatively small networks of sites, the error due to the sampling can be large and needs to be considered and quantified. The analysis of the spatial variability of the uncertainty helped to identify the meteorological drivers driving the uncertainty.},

Although Flux tower data represent point measurements with a footprint of typically 1 km \texttimes{} 1 km they can be used to validate models and to spatialize biospheric fluxes at regional and continental scales. In this paper we present a study where biospheric flux data collected in the EUROFLUX project were used to train a neural network simulator to provide spatial (1 km \texttimes{} 1 km) and temporal (weekly) estimates of carbon fluxes of European forests at continental scale. The novelty of the approach is that flux data were used to constrain and parameterize the neural network structure using a limited number of input driving variables. The overall European carbon uptake from this analysis was 0.47 Gt C yr-1 with distinctive differences between boreal and temperate regions. The length of the growing season is longer in the south of Europe (about 32 weeks), compared with north and central Europe, which have a similar length-growing season (about 27 weeks). A peak in respiration was depicted in spring at continental scale as a coherent signal which parallel the construction respiration increase at the onset of the season as usually shown by leaf level measurements.},

Currently more than 250 eddy covariance sites are active around the world measuring carbon exchange at high temporal resolution for different biomes and climatic conditions. In this paper a new standardized set of corrections is introduced and the uncertainties associated with these corrections are assessed for eight different forest sites in Europe with a total of 12 yearly datasets. The uncertainties introduced on the two components GPP (Gross Primary Production) and TER (Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration) are also discussed and a quantitative analysis presented. Through a factorial analysis we find that generally, uncertainties by different corrections are additive without interactions and that the heuristic u\textsubscript{*}-correction introduces the largest uncertainty. The results show that a standardized data processing is needed for an effective comparison across biomes and for underpinning inter-annual variability.

We focus on filling a long continuous gap (e.g., multiple months of missing daily observations) rather than on individual randomly missing observations. Our proposed gap filling algorithm uses an automated method for determining the optimal MLP model architecture, thus allowing for optimal prediction performance for the given time series. We tested our approach by filling gaps of various lengths (three months to three years) in three environmental datasets with different time series characteristics, namely daily groundwater levels, daily soil moisture, and hourly Net Ecosystem Exchange. We compared the accuracy of the gap-filled values obtained with our approach to the widely-used R-based time series gap filling methods ImputeTS and mtsdi. The results indicate that using an MLP for filling a large gap leads to better results, especially when the data behave nonlinearly. Thus, our approach enables the use of datasets that have a large gap in one variable, which is common in many long-term environmental monitoring observations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Roadside habitats are important for a range of taxa including plants, insects, mammals, and birds, particularly in developed countries in which large expanses of native vegetation have been cleared for agriculture or urban development. Although roadside vegetation may provide suitable habitat for many species, resident animals can be exposed to high levels of traffic noise, visual disturbance from passing vehicles, and the risk of collision with cars and trucks. Traffic noise can reduce the distance over which acoustic signals such as song can be detected, an effect known as acoustic interference or masking. Studies from the northern hemisphere show that the singing behavior of birds changes in the presence of traffic noise. We investigated the impact of traffic noise and traffic volume on two species of birds, the Grey Shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica) and the Grey Fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa), at 58 roadside sites on the Mornington Peninsula, southeastern Australia. The lower singing Grey Shrike-thrush sang at a higher frequency in the presence of traffic noise, with a predicted increase in dominant frequency of 5.8 Hz/dB of traffic noise, and a total effect size of 209 Hz. In contrast, the higher singing Grey Fantail did not appear to change its song in traffic noise. The probability of detecting each species on a visit to a site declined substantially with increasing traffic noise and traffic volume, with several lines of evidence supporting a larger effect of traffic noise. Traffic noise could hamper detection of song by conspecifics, making it more difficult for birds to establish and maintain territories, attract mates and maintain pair bonds, and possibly leading to reduced breeding success in noisy roadside habitats. Closing key roads during the breeding season is a potential, but untested, management strategy to protect threatened bird species from traffic noise and collision with vehicles at the time of year when they are most vulnerable to their impacts. Other management options include reducing the speed and/or volume of traffic on such roads to an acceptably low level. Ours is the first study to investigate the effect of traffic noise on the singing behavior of birds in the southern hemisphere.}

  abstract = {Observational data are fundamental for scientific research in almost any domain. Recent advances in sensor and data management technologies are enabling unprecedented amounts of observational data to be collected and analyzed. However, an essential part of using observational data is not currently as scalable as data collection and analysis methods: data quality assurance and control. While specialized tools for very narrow domains do exist, general methods are harder to create. This paper explores the identification of data issues that lead to the creation of data tests and tools to perform data quality control activities. Developing this identification step in a systematic manner allows for better and more general quality control tools. As our case study, we use carbon, water, and energy fluxes as well as micro-meteorological data collected at field sites that are part of FLUXNET, a network of over 400 ecosystem-level monitoring stations. In an effort toward the release of a new global data set of fluxes, we are doing data quality control for these data. The experience from this work led to the creation of a catalog of issues identified in the data. This paper presents this catalog and its generalization into a set of patterns of data quality issues that can be detected in observational data.},

  abstract = {Aims The 50th anniversary of the publication of the seminal book, The Theory of Island Biogeography, by Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson, is a timely moment to review and identify key research foci that could advance island biology. Here, we take a collaborative horizon-scanning approach to identify 50 fundamental questions for the continued development of the field. Location Worldwide. Methods We adapted a well-established methodology of horizon scanning to identify priority research questions in island biology, and initiated it during the Island Biology 2016 conference held in the Azores. A multidisciplinary working group prepared an initial pool of 187 questions. A series of online surveys was then used to refine a list of the 50 top priority questions. The final shortlist was restricted to questions with a broad conceptual scope, and which should be answerable through achievable research approaches. Results Questions were structured around four broad and partially overlapping island topics, including: (Macro)Ecology and Biogeography, (Macro)Evolution, Community Ecology, and Conservation and Management. These topics were then subdivided according to the following subject areas: global diversity patterns (five questions in total); island ontogeny and past climate change (4); island rules and syndromes (3); island biogeography theory (4); immigration\textendash speciation\textendash extinction dynamics (5); speciation and diversification (4); dispersal and colonization (3); community assembly (6); biotic interactions (2); global change (5); conservation and management policies (5); and invasive alien species (4). Main conclusions Collectively, this cross-disciplinary set of topics covering the 50 fundamental questions has the potential to stimulate and guide future research in island biology. By covering fields ranging from biogeography, community ecology and evolution to global change, this horizon scan may help to foster the formation of interdisciplinary research networks, enhancing joint efforts to better understand the past, present and future of island biotas.},

  abstract = {In situ temperature measurements revealed that the position of the high-elevation treeline is associated with a minimum seasonal mean air temperature within a temperature-defined minimum season length across latitudes. Here, we build upon this experience and present the results of a global statistical analysis and a predictive model for low temperature treeline positions. We identified 376 natural treelines from satellite images across the globe, and searched for their closest climatic proxies using a climate database. The analysis included a snow and a water balance submodel to account for season length constraints by snow pack and drought. We arrive at thermal treeline criteria almost identical to those that emerged from the earlier in situ measurements: tree growth requires a minimum length of the growing season of 94~days. The model yields best fit when the season is defined as all days with a daily mean temperature {$>$}0.9~\textdegree C, and a mean of 6.4~\textdegree C across all these days. The resultant treeline model `TREELIM' offers a robust estimation of potential treeline elevation based on climate data only. Error terms include imprecise treeline position in satellite images and climate approximations in mountainous terrain. The algorithm permits constraining low temperature limits of forest growth worldwide (including polar treelines) and also permits a bioclimatic stratification of mountain biota, for instance, for biodiversity assessments. As a side product, the model yields the global potentially forested area. The results support the isotherm theory for natural treeline formation. This completely independent statistical assessment of the climatic drivers of the global treeline phenomenon confirmed the results of a multi-year measurement campaign.},

On a planetary scale, this simple, familiar phenomenon\textemdash associated with a characteristic called albedo\textemdash drives weather and climate.

  abstract = {More humans reside in urban areas than at any other time in history. Protected urban green spaces and transportation greenbelts support many species, but diversity in these areas is generally lower than in undeveloped landscapes. Habitat degradation and fragmentation contribute to lowered diversity and urban homogenization, but less is known about the role of anthropogenic noise. Songbirds are especially vulnerable to anthropogenic noise because they rely on acoustic signals for communication. Recent studies suggest that anthropogenic noise reduces the density and reproductive success of some bird species, but that species which vocalize at frequencies above those of anthropogenic noise are more likely to inhabit noisy areas. We hypothesize that anthropogenic noise is contributing to declines in urban diversity by reducing the abundance of select species in noisy areas, and that species with low-frequency songs are those most likely to be affected. To examine this relationship, we calculated the noise-associated change in overall species richness and in abundance for seven common songbird species. After accounting for variance due to vegetative differences, species richness and the abundance of three of seven species were reduced in noisier locations. Acoustic analysis revealed that minimum song frequency was highly predictive of a species' response to noise, with lower minimum song frequencies incurring greater noise-associated reduction in abundance. These results suggest that anthropogenic noise affects some species independently of vegetative conditions, exacerbating the exclusion of some songbird species in otherwise suitable habitat. Minimum song frequency may provide a useful metric to predict how particular species will be affected by noise. In sum, mitigation of noise may enhance habitat suitability for many songbird species, especially for species with songs that include low-frequency elements.},

Potential complex nonlinear interactions among the new features create a significant challenge for understanding the model behaviors and parameter tuning. Using the one-at-a-time method, the benefit of tuning one parameter may offset the benefit of tuning another parameter, or improvement in one target variable may lead to degradation in another target variable. To better understand the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 model behaviors and physics, we conducted a large number of short simulations (three days) in which 18 parameters carefully selected from parameterizations of deep convection, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics and microphysics were perturbed simultaneously using the Latin hypercube sampling method. From the perturbed parameter ensemble simulations and use of different skill score functions, we identified the most sensitive parameters, quantified how the model responds to changes of the parameters for both global mean and spatial distribution, and estimated the maximum likelihood of model parameter space for a number of important fidelity metrics. Comparison of the parametric sensitivity using simulations of two different lengths suggests that perturbed parameter ensemble using short simulations has some bearing on understanding parametric sensitivity of longer simulations. Results from this analysis provide a more comprehensive picture of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 behavior. The difficulty in reducing biases in multiple variables simultaneously highlights the need of characterizing model structural uncertainty (so-called embedded errors) to inform future development efforts.},

Relatedness of progeny within fruits was similar for all populations, revealing single sires within fruits. However, relatedness of progeny between fruits within trees was consistently greater for trees in fragmented conditions across 4 yr. We found high levels of genetic structure of pollen pools in all populations with more structure in isolated trees. The effective number of pollen donors was greater for trees in undisturbed forest than in disturbed conditions. \textbullet{} Conclusions: Our study showed that the progeny produced by isolated trees in disturbed habitats are sired by a fraction of the diversity of pollen donors found in conserved forests. The foraging behavior of bats limits the exchange of pollen between trees, causing higher levels of progeny relatedness in isolated trees.},

In general, the environments are arid and semi-arid with summers characterised by high temperatures and small precipitation. Due to the scarcity of water resources, the correct evaluation of water losses by the crops as evapotranspiration (ET) is very important in these regions. In this paper, we initially present the most known ET measurement methods classified according to the used approach: hydrological, micrometeorological and plant physiological. In the following, we describe the methods to estimate ET, distinguishing the methods based on analytical approaches from the methods based on empirical approaches. Ten methods are reviewed: soil water balance, weighing lysimeter, energy balance/Bowen ratio, aerodynamic method, eddy covariance, sap flow method, chambers system, Penman\textendash Monteith model, crop coefficient approach and soil water balance modelling approach. In the presentation of each method, we have recalled the basic principles, underlined the time and space scale of its application and analysed its accuracy and suitability for use in arid and semi-arid environments. A specific section is dedicated to advection. Finally, the specific problems of each method for correct use in the Mediterranean region are underlined. In conclusion, we focus attention on the most interesting new guidelines for research on the measurement and estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods that separate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into its major components, gross ecosystem carbon uptake (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems. We show that the temperature sensitivity of Reco, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach {$>$}25\% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP. Conversely, in summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems, the long-term temperature sensitivity is lower than the short-term temperature sensitivity resulting in underestimation of annual sums of respiration. We introduce a new generic algorithm that derives a short-term temperature sensitivity of Reco from eddy covariance data that applies this to the extrapolation from night- to daytime, and that further performs a filling of data gaps that exploits both, the covariance between fluxes and meteorological drivers and the temporal structure of the fluxes. While this algorithm should give less biased estimates of GEP and Reco, we discuss the remaining biases and recommend that eddy covariance measurements are still backed by ancillary flux measurements that can reduce the uncertainties inherent in the eddy covariance data.},

The meteorological gap-filling method ingests data from nearby towers or climate stations and uses simple interpolation techniques to fill missing half-hourly data values. These gap-filled forcing datasets are uncertain because of the gap-filling technique and because of potential biases in the tower observations such as the underestimation of precipitation or poor calibration of radiometers. Here we examine the effects of uncertainty in this forcing dataset at selected sites with two models. For each site, an ensemble of 10 forcing datasets is created using varying methods of bias correction, interpolation, and selection of nearby sites for gap-filling. We include the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset as one of the ensemble members to quantify uncertainties caused by using reanalysis data. We examine the effects of forcing uncertainty on net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re) and latent heat (LE) at multiple timescales, with a particular focus on the interannual variability of these flux variables. We also examine the sensitivity of fluxes at each site to individual uncertainties in three variables: temperature, precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).},

In this hypsometer, water is heated electrically, and its boiling temperature is measured with a thermocouple. Once the boiling temperature is known, pressure is determined via the water vapor saturation pressure curve.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The pressure range required is 1050\textendash 10 hPa, that is, slightly more than two orders of magnitude. In order to achieve an accuracy of 0.05\% in pressure (0.5 hPa at 1000 hPa), boiling temperature must be measured to about 0.01 K. This formidable requirement calls for very accurate calibration procedures that are novel in thermocouple thermometry. However, once the thermocouple is calibrated, individual hypsometers utilizing thermocouples made of the same batch of material do not require calibration. For computing pressure from boiling temperature, the Goff-Gratch reference function is suggested; if approximations cannot be avoided, they must be specially selected. When using another liquid (e.g., fluorochlorohydrocarbons) in the hypsometer, the accuracy required for the temperature measurement would be reduced, however, water was chosen because it is environmentally harmless.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Apart from the fact that the hypsometer does not require individual calibration, its advantage over other pressure sensors is the fact that a given uncertainty in boiling temperature leads to a practically constant relative pressure error {$<$}em{$>$}dp{$<$}/em{$>$}/{$<$}em{$>$}p{$<$}/em{$>$} over the entire pressure range. Consequently, heights computed for the hypsometer sondes are more accurate than those obtained from sondes employing other pressure sensors (e.g., aneroids), as was confirmed in an intercomparison. The hypsometer is operationally used in the SRS radiosonde by the Swiss Meteorological Institute; so far nearly 3500 successful flights have been made.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The observation that small isolated populations often suffer reduced fitness from inbreeding depression has guided conservation theory and practice for decades. However, investigating the genome-wide dynamics associated with inbreeding depression in natural populations is only now feasible with relatively inexpensive sequencing technology and annotated reference genomes. To characterize the genome-wide effects of intense inbreeding and isolation, we performed whole-genome sequencing and morphological analysis of an iconic inbred population, the gray wolves (Canis lupus) of Isle Royale. Through population genetic simulations and comparison with wolf genomes from a variety of demographic histories, we find evidence that severe inbreeding depression in this population is due to increased homozygosity of strongly deleterious recessive mutations. Our results have particular relevance in light of the recent translocation of wolves from the mainland to Isle Royale, as well as broader implications for management of genetic variation in the fragmented landscape of the modern world. Extended runs of homozygosity harboring recessive mutations underlie severe inbreeding depression in Isle Royale wolves.

The present investigation examined the evidence of long-distance transport of pollen from these populations during the 1996/1997 season at three sites in Oklahoma using Burkard traps. Two of the pollen-monitoring stations were operated in conjunction with Mesonet meteorological stations. It was found that the December and January Cupressaceae pollen occurs outside of the local season at Tulsa. Pollen concentrations are intermittent and correspond to days of peak concentrations at sites nearer the mountain cedar populations. Peak concentrations are associated with winds coming from the south over the mountain cedar areas. Diurnal rhythms show night-time peaks with a delay in timing at the northern-most site. These results are all consistent with the hypothesis that pollen is being transported over long distances from the mountain cedar populations to Tulsa, Oklahoma. These findings are important as they represent one of the few incidences of long-distance transport of pollen in significant concentrations to an area where the source vegetation is not present. Pollen-monitoring sites located in conjunction with Mesonet meteorological stations provide a unique opportunity to further examine atmospheric conditions during long-distance transport events. This will aid future studies of the spatial modeling of long-distance dispersal of pollen.},

  abstract = {Fragmentation of tropical forest represents a major threat to some tree populations by reducing local population size and gene flow from other populations. Both processes can decrease outcrossing rates and genetic variation in remnant stands. Despite these risks, some tree species have pollen vectors that mitigate these negative consequences for fragmented populations. In this paper, we assess both pollen flow and diversity of pollen sources in continuous forest and isolated stands of Swietenia humilis, a tropical tree species pollinated by small insects. Using seven nuclear microsatellite markers, we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity and the number of pollen donors are lower in remnant populations. Results show that allelic richness of seeds is lower in isolated populations (6.1 vs. 8.3 alleles per locus), even though adult populations do not show this difference. Pollen pool structure is greater in isolated patches ({$\Phi$}Iso=0.26) than in continuous forest ({$\Phi$}For=0.14), which yields estimates of the average effective number of pollen donors (Nep) of 1.9 and 3.6 respectively. In addition, estimates of number of sires per mother indicate that isolated trees have half the number of pollen sources (4.98) than trees in the forest (9.8). Although extensive pollen movement ({$>$}2000m) was recorded on both habitat conditions, indicating that fragmented patches are not isolated from pollen-mediated gene flow, this extensive pollen flow among trees in fragmented landscapes may not serve to counteract deleterious reproductive and genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation.},

However, linking traits to tree performance has proven challenging likely due to a failure to consider physiological traits (i.e. hard-traits) and the failure to integrate organ-level and whole plant-level trait information. Here, we modelled the survival rate and relative growth rate of trees while considering crown allocation, hard-traits and local-scale biotic interactions, and compared these models to more traditional trait-based models of tree performance. We found that an integrative trait, total tree-level photosynthetic mass (estimated by multiplying specific leaf area and crown area) results in superior models of tree survival and growth. These models had a lower AIC than those including the effect of initial tree size or any other combination of the traits considered. Survival rates were positively related to higher values of crown area and photosynthetic mass, while relative growth rates were negatively related to the photosynthetic mass. Relative growth rates were negatively related to a neighbourhood crowding index. Furthermore, none of the hard-traits used in this study provided an improvement in tree performance models. Synthesis. Overall, our results highlight that models of tree performance can be greatly improved by including crown area information to generate a better understanding of plant responses to their environment. Additionally, the role of the hard-traits in improving models of tree performance is likely dependent upon the level of stress (e.g. drought stress), micro-environmental conditions or short-term climatic variations that a particular forest experiences.},

The EC method is central to the ecosystem component of the Integrated Carbon Observation System, a monitoring network for greenhouse gases across the European Continent. The data processing sequence applied to the collected raw data is complex, and multiple robust options for the different steps are often available. For Integrated Carbon Observation System and similar networks, the standardisation of methods is essential to avoid methodological biases and improve comparability of the results. We introduce here the steps of the processing chain applied to the eddy covariance data of Integrated Carbon Observation System stations for the estimation of final CO2, water and energy fluxes, including the calculation of their uncertainties. The selected methods are discussed against valid alternative options in terms of suitability and respective drawbacks and advantages. The main challenge is to warrant standardised processing for all stations in spite of the large differences in e.g. ecosystem traits and site conditions. The main achievement of the Integrated Carbon Observation System eddy covariance data processing is making CO2 and energy flux results as comparable and reliable as possible, given the current micrometeorological understanding and the generally accepted state-of-the-art processing methods.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the most important information fusion data-driven algorithms based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for problems in Earth observation. Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables, at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to obtain the data when needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook the near future of the field.},

  abstract = {Extensive exploration of simulation models comes at a high computational cost, all the more when the model involves a lot of parameters. Economists usually rely on random explorations, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and basic econometric modeling to approximate the properties of computational models. This paper aims to provide guidelines for the use of a much more efficient method that combines a parsimonious sampling of the parameter space using a specific design of experiments (DoE), with a well-suited metamodeling method first developed in geostatistics: kriging. We illustrate these guidelines by following them in the analysis of two simple and well known economic models: Nelson and Winter's industrial dynamics model, and Cournot oligopoly with learning firms. In each case, we show that our DoE experiments can catch the main effects of the parameters on the models' dynamics with a much lower number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo sampling (e.g. 85 simulations instead of 2,000 in the first case). In the analysis of the second model, we also introduce supplementary numerical tools that may be combined with this method, for characterizing configurations complying with a specific criterion (social optimal, replication of stylized facts, etc.). Our appendix gives an example of the R-project code that can be used to apply this method on other models, in order to encourage other researchers to quickly test this approach on their models.},

Grey squirrels compete with the native species mainly for food; furthermore, they can maintain and spread a poxvirus, which causes a lethal disease in red squirrels in Britain. According to some modelling scenarios, grey squirrels will spread from Italy to France and Switzerland in the next 20\textendash 30 years, and to a large part of Eurasia in the long term. This would represent a serious threat for the survival of the red squirrel throughout its range. This case study of biological invasion suggests that the risks posed by the introduced species may be minimized with a reduction in animal trade between countries and using a procedure of risk-assessment for every imported species.}

Many of the LSMs' soil and vegetation parameters were highly uncertain so that it is crucially important to efficiently optimize them. Here I present a globally applicable and computationally efficient method for parameter optimization and uncertainty assessment of the LSM by combining Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with machine learning. First, I performed the long-term (decadal-scale) ensemble simulation of the LSM, in which each ensemble member has different parameters' values, and calculated the gap between simulation and observation, or the cost function, for each ensemble member. Second, I developed the statistical machine learning-based surrogate model, which is computationally cheap but accurately mimics the relationship between parameters and the cost function, by applying the Gaussian process regression to learn the model simulation. Third, I applied MCMC by repeatedly evaluating the surrogate model to get the posterior probabilistic distribution of parameters. Using satellite passive microwave brightness temperature observations, both synthetic and real-data experiments in the Sahel region of west Africa were performed to optimize unknown soil and vegetation parameters of the LSM. The primary findings are (1) the proposed method is 50,000 times as fast as the direct application of MCMC to the full LSM; (2) the skill of the LSM to simulate both soil moisture and vegetation dynamics can be improved; and (3) I successfully quantify the characteristics of equifinality by obtaining the full nonparametric probabilistic distribution of parameters.},

  abstract = {Healthy forests provide many of the essential ecosystem services upon which all life depends. Genetic diversity is an essential component of long-term forest health because it provides a basis for adaptation and resilience to environmental stress and change. In addition to natural processes, numerous anthropogenic factors deplete forest genetic resources. Genetic losses could be particularly consequential now because robust resilience is needed to respond to a growing number, variety, and frequency of stress exposures. Silvicultural management that selectively removes trees (and their genes) from forests may be another force reshaping forest gene pools. Although data concerning the influence of silvicultural management on genetic resources in temperate forests is somewhat mixed, through the genetic assessment of long-term silvicultural treatments within an eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forest, and computer-based simulated harvests of a genetically mapped eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) stand, we found that the selective removal of trees can alter gene frequencies. Due to an association with phenotypic characteristics used to guide harvests, the frequencies of rare alleles appeared particularly vulnerable to manipulation. Depending on the selection criteria used, rare allele frequencies either remained steady, decreased, or increased relative to study controls. Although harvest-associated genetic losses are possible, our data suggests that management can also sustain or enhance genetic richness. Similar to studies within temperate ecosystems, recent research in tropical forests underscores the potential influence of harvesting on the genetics of tree populations. In addition to efforts to reduce controllable sources of ecosystem stress (e.g., high pollutant exposures), management options should be evaluated that may bolster forest ecosystem resilience by preserving levels of genetic diversity within forests.},

  abstract = {Rough mountain terrain offers climatic conditions (niches) to plants and animals poorly represented by conventional climate station data. However, the extent to which actual temperatures deviate from those of the freely circulating atmosphere had never been assessed at a landscape level. Here, we quantify thermal life conditions across topographically rich mountain terrain by using a combination of thermal (IR) imagery of surface temperature with data from a large number of miniature data loggers buried at 3 cm soil depth. The data obtained from six alpine (Alps) and arctic-alpine slopes (Norway, Sweden, Svalbard) evidence persistent root zone temperatures of 2\textendash 4 K above air temperature during summer. Surface temperatures show strong positive (2\textendash 9 K) and negative (3\textendash 8 K) deviations from air temperature on bright days and clear nights, respectively. As to be expected, south oriented slopes are warmer than west and north slopes but microclimatic variation on clear sky days was strong within all slopes, with 8.4{$\pm$}2.5 K (mean{$\pm$}SD) surface temperature differences persisting over several hours per day along horizontal (i.e., equal elevation) transects. Life conditions of alpine organisms are thus strongly decoupled from conditions in the free atmosphere and cannot reliably be inferred from climate station data in both, temperate and arctic latitudes. Microtopography can mimic temperature differences of large elevational (or latitudinal) gradients over very short horizontal distances. This is important in the context of climate change because it shows that species do not necessarily need to climb several hundred meters in elevation to escape the warmth. Quite often, few meters of horizontal shift will do. For plants unable to, or too slow to adapt to a warmer climate, thermal microhabitat mosaics offer both refuge habitats as well as stepping stones as atmospheric temperatures rise.},

The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

This sink-estimate is produced by an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models and is consistent with the land uptake inferred from the residual of emissions and ocean uptake. The purpose of our study is to understand how well terrestrial biosphere models reproduce the processes that drive the terrestrial carbon sink. One challenge is to decide what level of agreement between model output and observation-based reference data is adequate considering that reference data are prone to uncertainties. To define such a level of agreement, we compute benchmark scores that quantify the similarity between independently derived reference data sets using multiple statistical metrics. Models are considered to perform well if their model scores reach benchmark scores. Our results show that reference data can differ considerably, causing benchmark scores to be low. Model scores are often of similar magnitude as benchmark scores, implying that model performance is reasonable given how different reference data are. While model performance is encouraging, ample potential for improvements remains, including a reduction in a positive leaf area index bias, improved representations of processes that govern soil organic carbon in high latitudes, and an assessment of causes that drive the inter-model spread of gross primary productivity in boreal regions and humid tropics. The success of future model development will increasingly depend on our capacity to reduce and account for observational uncertainties.},

For this purpose, the program "SWRC Fit," which performs nonlinear fitting of soil water retention curves to 5 models by Levenberg-Marquardt method, was developed. The five models are the Brooks and Corey model, the van Genuchten model, Kosugi's log-normal pore-size distribution model, Durner's bimodal pore-size distribution model, and a bimodal log-normal pore-size distribution model propose in this study. This program automatically determines all the necessary conditions for the nonlinear fitting, such as the initial estimate of the parameters, and, therefore, users can simply input the soil water retention data to obtain the necessary parameters. The program can be executed directly from a web page at http://purl.org/net/swrc/; a client version of the software written in numeric calculation language GNU Octave is included in the electronic supplement of this paper. The program was used for determining the soil hydraulic parameters of 420 soils in UNSODA database. After comparing the root mean square error of the unimodal models, the van Genuchten and Kosugi's models were better than the Brooks and Corey model. The bimodal log-normal pore-size distribution model had similar fitting performance to Durner's bimodal pore-size distribution model.},

Despite growing knowledge of physiological and behavioural responses to these stimuli from single-species and local-scale studies, whether these pollutants affect fitness is less clear, as is how and why species vary in their sensitivity to these anthropic stressors. Here we leverage a large citizen science dataset paired with high-resolution noise and light data from across the contiguous United States to assess how these stimuli affect reproductive success in 142 bird species. We find responses to both sensory pollutants linked to the functional traits and habitat affiliations of species. For example, overall nest success was negatively correlated with noise among birds in closed environments. Species-specific changes in reproductive timing and hatching success in response to noise exposure were explained by vocalization frequency, nesting location and diet. Additionally, increased light-gathering ability of species' eyes was associated with stronger advancements in reproductive timing in response to light exposure, potentially creating phenological mismatches7. Unexpectedly, better light-gathering ability was linked to reduced clutch failure and increased overall nest success in response to light exposure, raising important questions about how responses to sensory pollutants counteract or exacerbate responses to other aspects of global change, such as climate warming. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic noise and light can substantially affect breeding bird phenology and fitness, and underscore the need to consider sensory pollutants alongside traditional dimensions of the environment that typically inform biodiversity conservation.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a new multi-hybrid Model in which six input variables consist of methane, ethane, propane, and nitrogen components composition along with suction and discharge pressures have been employed in order to estimate and predict the optimal consumed power. Having replaced by pure ethylene cycle in the olefin plant of the Tabriz Petrochemical Complex, the one and two stage-cascade cycles are modeled continuously by the proposed model. A hybrid group method of data handling (GMDH) along with linking between Aspen HYSYS and MATLAB software, optimized with Genetic algorithm (GA), is herein proposed to obtain efficient polynomial correlation to estimate optimal consumed power for these two cascade cycles. Results show that the proposed multi-hybrid model is superior to non-linear programming techniques for obtaining the optimum consumed power of cascade refrigeration cycles and finding the values of optimizing variables.},

  abstract = {The eddy covariance (EC) method is state-of-the-art in directly measuring vegetation-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and H2O at ecosystem scale. However, the EC method is currently limited to a small number of atmospheric tracers by the lack of suitable fast-response analyzers or poor signal-to-noise ratios. High resource and power demands may further restrict the number of spatial sampling points. True eddy accumulation (TEA) is an alternative method for direct and continuous flux observations. Key advantages are the applicability to a wider range of air constituents such as greenhouse gases, isotopes, volatile organic compounds and aerosols using slow-response analyzers. In contrast to relaxed eddy accumulation (REA), true eddy accumulation (Desjardins, 1977) has the advantage of being a direct method which does not require proxies. True Eddy Accumulation has the potential to overcome above mentioned limitations of eddy covariance but has hardly ever been successfully demonstrated in practice in the past. This study presents flux measurements using an innovative approach to true eddy accumulation by directly, continuously and automatically measuring trace gas fluxes using a flow-through system. We merge high-frequency flux contributions from TEA with low-frequency covariances from the same sensors. We show flux measurements of CO2, CH4 and H2O by TEA and EC above an old-growth forest at the ICOS flux tower site "Hainich" (DE-Hai). We compare and evaluate the performance of the two direct turbulent flux measurement methods eddy covariance and true eddy accumulation using side-by-side trace gas flux observations. We further compare performance of seven instrument complexes, i.e. combinations of sonic anemometers and trace gas analyzers. We compare gas analyzers types of open-path, enclosed-path and closed-path design. We further differentiate data from two gas analysis technologies: infrared gas analysis (IRGA) and laser spectrometry (open path and CRDS closed-path laser spectrometers). We present results of CO2 and H2O fluxes from the following six instruments, i.e. combinations of sonic anemometers/gas analyzers (and methods): METEK-uSonic3/Picarro-G2301 (TEA), METEK-uSonic3/LI-7500 (EC), Gill-R3/LI-6262 (EC), Gill-R3/LI-7200 (EC), Gill-HS/LI-7200 (EC), Gill-R3/LGR-FGGA (EC). Further, we present results of much more difficult to measure CH4 fluxes from the following three instruments, i.e. combinations of sonic anemometers/gas analyzers (and methods): METEK-uSonic3/Picarro-G2301 (TEA), Gill-R3/LI-7700 (EC), Gill-R3/LGR-FGGA (EC). We observed that CO2, CH4 and H2O fluxes from the side-by-side measurements by true eddy accumulation and eddy covariance methods correlated well. Secondly, the difference between the TEA and EC methods using the same sonic anemometer but different gas analyzer was often smaller than the mismatch of the various side-by-side eddy covariance measurements using different sonic anemometers and gas analyzers. Signal-to-noise ratios of CH4 fluxes from the true eddy accumulation system system were superior to both eddy covariance sensors (open-path LI-7700 and closed-path CRDS LGR-FGGA sensors). We conclude that our novel implementation of the true eddy accumulation method demonstrated high signal-to-noise ratios, applicability to slow-response gas analyzers, small power consumption and direct proxy-free ecosystem-scale trace gas flux measurements of CO2, CH4 and H2O. The current results suggest that true eddy accumulation would be suitable and should be applied as the method-of-choice for direct flux measurements of a large number of atmospheric constituents beyond CO2 and H2O, including isotopes, aerosols, volatile organic compounds and other trace gases for which eddy covariance might not be a viable alternative. We will further develop true eddy accumulation as a novel approach using multiplexed systems for spatially distributed flux measurements.},

One group of estimates synthesizes global cloud, aerosol, and other information in a radiation model that is used to calculate fluxes. Because these synthesis fluxes have been assessed against observations, the global-mean values of these fluxes are deemed to be the most credible of the four different categories reviewed. The global, annual mean DLR lies between approximately 344 and 350 W m\textsuperscript{-2} with an error of approximately {$\pm$}10 W m\textsuperscript{-2} that arises mostly from the uncertainty in atmospheric state that governs the estimation of the clear-sky emission. The authors conclude that the DLR derived from global climate models are biased low by approximately 10 W m\textsuperscript{-2} and even larger differences are found with respect to reanalysis climate data. The DLR inferred from a surface energy balance closure is also substantially smaller that the range found from synthesis products suggesting that current depictions of surface energy balance also require revision. The effect of clouds on the DLR, largely facilitated by the new cloud base information from the {$<$}em{$>$}CloudSat{$<$}/em{$>$} radar, is estimated to lie in the range from 24 to 34 W m\textsuperscript{-2} for the global cloud radiative effect (all-sky minus clear-sky DLR). This effect is strongly modulated by the underlying water vapor that gives rise to a maximum sensitivity of the DLR to cloud occurring in the colder drier regions of the planet. The bottom of atmosphere (BOA) cloud effect directly contrast the effect of clouds on the top of atmosphere (TOA) fluxes that is maximum in regions of deepest and coldest clouds in the moist tropics.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Missing data, which commonly appears in multivariate time series, has been widely recognized as a key challenge in time series analysis. Many commonly used imputation methods either ignore the temporal dependencies of time series data, or do not adequately utilize the relationships among variables. State-ofthe-art methods on time series imputation are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which utilize the historical information to estimate current values sequentially. However, RNNs rely heavily on the output of nearby timestamps, which may lead to important information lost for long sequences. Moreover, individual variables typically present different dynamics and missingness patterns, which is neglected by the global RNN hidden states. In this paper, we propose an imputation framework to learn both global and local dependencies of multivariate time series, as well as a multi-dimensional self-attention to learn capture distant correlations across both time and feature. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task, and benefits the downstream task.},

Therefore, understanding factors that strengthen and erode pair bonds are important in elucidating the selection pressures that avian populations will experience. Here, we studied the effects of environmental noise on pair bonds and the strength of pair preferences (i.e. preferences for a pair-bonded partner versus an unfamiliar individual) in the monogamous zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a model species in studies of sexual selection. Based on a previous study, we hypothesized that high-amplitude environmental noise would decrease the strength of pair preferences. Explicitly, we tested whether females' relative preference for their pair-bonded males, compared with extrapair males, decreased as the amplitude of environmental white noise increased. Our results generally supported our hypothesis, as females' preference for their pair-bonded males significantly decreased under conditions of high environmental noise. This erosion of preference may result from the masking or distortion of the paired males' pair-bond maintaining call, although the decrease in preference could also occur because a female cannot recognize her pair-bonded male. Our findings suggest that songbird populations in areas with high environmental noise may have (temporarily or permanently) weakened pair bonds, suggesting that extrapair behaviours could increase in areas of greater environmental noise.},

A range of conservation actions has been proposed to allow biodiversity to respond to those environmental changes. However, determining the relative effectiveness of these actions has been hampered by incomplete evidence. Empirical studies have provided important insights to inform conservation, but the challenge of considering multiple actions at large spatial and temporal scales is considerable. We adopt an individual-based modelling approach to qualitatively assess the effectiveness of alternative conservation actions in facilitating range expansion and patch occupancy for eight virtual species. We test actions to: (i) improve the quality of existing habitat patches, (ii) increase the permeability of the surrounding matrix, (iii) restore degraded habitat, (iv) create new habitat patches to form stepping-stones or (v) create new habitat to enlarge existing habitat patches. These actions are systematically applied to six real landscapes of the UK, which differ in their degree of habitat fragmentation and availability. Creating new habitat close to existing patches typically provides the strongest benefits for both range expansion and patch occupancy across species and landscapes. However, some landscapes may be so degraded that even under unrealistically high levels of management action, species' performances cannot be rescued. We identify that it is possible to develop a triage of conservation actions at the landscape, species and investment level, thereby providing timely evidence to inform action on the ground to lessen the hangover from the deadly anthropogenic cocktail.},

It has usually been combined with proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), an online technique for VOC concentration measurements. However, the determination of the lag time between wind and concentration measurements has remained an important challenge. To address this issue, we studied the effect of different lag time methods on DEC fluxes. The analysis was based on both actual DEC measurements with PTR-MS and simulated DEC data derived from high frequency H2O measurements with an infrared gas analyzer. Conventional eddy covariance fluxes of H2O served as a reference in the DEC simulation. The individual flux measurements with PTR-MS were rather sensitive to the lag time methods, but typically this effect averaged out when the median fluxes were considered. The DEC simulation revealed that the maximum covariance method was prone to overestimation of the absolute values of fluxes. The constant lag time methods, one based on a value calculated from the sampling flow and the sampling line dimensions and the other on a typical daytime value, had a tendency to underestimate. The visual assessment method and our new averaging approach utilizing running averaged covariance functions did not yield statistically significant errors and thus fared better than the habitual choice, the maximum covariance method. Given this feature and the potential for automatic flux calculation, we recommend using the averaging approach in DEC measurements with PTR-MS. It also seems well suited to conventional eddy covariance applications when measuring fluxes near the detection limit.},

The method presented is characterized by a dynamic selection of the reconstructing stations and of the coupling period that can precede or follow the missing data. Each gap is considered as a specific case, identifying the best set of stations and the period that minimizes the estimated reconstruction error for the gap, thus permitting a potentially better adaptation to time-dependent factors affecting the relationships between stations. The best sampling size is determined through an inference procedure, permitting a highly specific selection of the parameters used to fill each gap in the time series. With a proper selection of the parameters, the average errors of reconstruction are close to 0 and those corresponding to the 95th percentile are typically around 0.1\textdegree C. In comparison with similar regression-based approaches, the errors are lower, particularly for minimum temperatures, and the method limits inversions between the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures.},

The study consists of a high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem and a global sensitivity analysis. For the first time in karst hydrology, we use the active subspace method to find directions in the parameter space that dominate the Bayesian update from the prior to the posterior distribution in order to effectively reduce the dimension of the problem and for computational efficiency. Additionally, the calculated active subspace can be exploited to construct sensitivity metrics on each of the individual parameters and be used to construct a natural model surrogate. The model consists of 21 parameters to reproduce the hydrological behavior of spring discharge in a karst aquifer located in the Kerschbaum spring recharge area at Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs in Austria. The experimental spatial and time series data for the inference process were collected by the water works in Waidhofen. We show that this case study has implicit low dimensionality, and we run an adjusted Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a low-dimensional subspace to construct samples of the posterior distribution. The results are visualized and verified by plots of the posterior's push-forward distribution displaying the uncertainty in predicting discharge values due to the experimental noise in the data. Finally, a discussion provides hydrological interpretation of these results for the Kerschbaum area.},

  abstract = {The Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) is a micrometeorological method often used to estimate latent heat flux because of its simplicity, robustness, and cost. Estimates of latent heat flux have compared favorably with other methods in several studies, but other studies have been less certain, especially when there was sensible heat advection. We compared the latent heat flux of irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa, L.) estimated by the BREB method with that measured by lysimeters over a growing season in the semi-arid, advective environment of the southern High Plains. Difference statistics from the comparison and indicators of sensible heat advection were used to analyze the performance of the BREB method relative to lysimeters. Latent heat flux was calculated from mass change measured by two precision weighing lysimeters and from two BREB systems that used interchanging temperature and humidity sensors. Net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), and other meteorological variables were also measured. Difference statistics included the root mean square difference (RMSD) and relative RMSD (normalized by mean lysimeter latent heat flux). Differences between lysimeters averaged 5\textendash 15\% during the day, and 25\textendash 45\% at night. Estimates of latent heat flux by the two BREB systems agreed closely (relative RMSD=8\%) when they were at the same location with sensors at the same height. Differences increased when the location was the same but sensors were at different heights, or when the sensor height was the same but location in the field different, and probably was related to limited fetch and the influence of different source areas beyond the field. Relative RMSD between lysimeter and BREB latent heat fluxes averaged by cutting was 25\textendash 29\% during the first two cuttings and decreased to 16\textendash 19\% during the last three cuttings. Relative RMSD between the methods varied from 17 to 28\% during morning hours with no pattern based on cutting. Afternoon relative RMSD was 25\% during the first two cuttings and decreased to 15\% during subsequent cuttings. Greatest differences between the two methods were measured when the Bowen ratios were less than 0, on days that were hot, dry and windy, or when the latent heat flux exceeded the available energy (Rn-G). These conditions were likely to be encountered throughout the growing season, but were more common earlier in the season.},

In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&lt; 0.5), ecosystem respiration (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&gt; 0.6), gross primary production (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}\&gt; 0.7), latent heat (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&gt; 0.7), sensible heat (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&gt; 0.7), and net radiation (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&gt; 0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&gt; 0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} \&lt; 0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics).

However, many elements contribute to the uncertainty of such estimate. In this study, the uncertainties of eight days gross primary production (GPP) predicted by Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were analysed at the site, ecosystem and European spatial scales. At the site level, the uncertainties caused by the missing of key drivers were evaluated. The most accurate predictions of eight days GPP were obtained when all available drivers were used (Pearson's correlation coefficient, {$\rho\sptilde$}0.84; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\textasciitilde 1.8g C m-2 d-1). However, when predictions were based on only remotely sensed data the accuracy was close to the optimum ({$\rho\sptilde$}0.8; RMSE\textasciitilde 1.9g C m-2 d-1) and to a commonly used light use efficiency model (MOD17) with parameters optimised for the applied study sites (the MOD17+, {$\rho\sptilde$}0.79; RMSE\textasciitilde 2.04g C m-2 d-1). Remotely sensed data were key drivers for the accurate prediction of GPP in ecosystems with high variability of green biomass over the phenological cycle (e.g., deciduous broad-leaved forests) or highly affected by the human management (e.g. croplands). In contrast, in the ecosystems with low variability of greenness (e.g., evergreen broad-leaved forests), the predictions were poor when meteorological information were not used. At a European spatial scale, when modelled grids of meteorological, land cover and fPAR data were used as inputs, the propagation of their uncertainty, not accounted in the models training, had significant effects on the uncertainty of the mean annual GPP. At this scale, the effects of meteorological uncertainty were higher than the misclassification error. These findings suggested that a strategy based on satellite-measured data could be a favourable improvement for the spatial upscaling of GPP, because avoiding the propagation of the uncertainties of the modelled grids.},

As measures for environmental heterogeneity, we used elevation ranges and precipitation ranges, which are well-known correlates of species richness.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents Mannga (Multiple variables with Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm), a method designed for gap filling meteorological data. The main approach is to estimate the missing data based on values of other meteorological variables measured at the same time in the same local, since the meteorological variables are strongly related. Experimental tests showed the performance of Mannga compared with other two methods typically used by researches in this area. Good results were achieved, with high accuracy even for sequential failures, which is a big challenge for researchers. The core advantages of Mannga are the flexibility of handling different types of meteorological data, the ability of select the best variables to assist the gap filling and the capacity to deal with sequential failures. Moreover, the method is available to public use with the Java programming language.},

  abstract = {The NRT algorithm for near-real time estimation of global LAI, FAPAR, and FCOVER variables from SPOT/VEGETATION (VGT) satellite data is described here. It consists of three steps: 1) neural networks (NNT) (one for each variable) to provide instantaneous estimates from daily VGT-P reflectances; 2) a multistep filtering approach to eliminate data mainly affected by atmospheric effects and snow cover; and 3) Savitzky-Golay and climatology temporal smoothing and gap filling techniques to ensure consistency and continuity as well as short-term projection of the product dynamics. Performances of NRT estimates were evaluated by comparing with other products over the 2005-2008 period: 1) the offline estimates from the application of the algorithm over historical time series (HIST); 2) the geoland2 version 1 products also issued from VGT (GEOV1/VGT); and 3) ground data. NRT rapidly converges closely to the HIST processing after six dekads (10-day period) with major improvement after two dekads. Successive reprocessing will, therefore, correct for some instabilities observed in the presence of noisy and missing data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between NRT and HIST LAI is lower than 0.4 in all cases. It shows a rapid exponential decay with the number of observations in the composition window with convergence when 30 observations are available. NRT products are in good agreement with ground data (RMSE of 0.69 for LAI, 0.09 for FAPAR, and 0.14 for FCOVER) and consistent with GEOV1/VGT products with a significant improvement in terms of continuity (only 1\% of missing data) and smoothness, especially at high latitudes, and Equatorial areas.},

  abstract = {Half-hourly time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) measured through the micro-meteorological eddy covariance (EC) technique are noisy and show a high percentage of missing data. By using EC measurements that are part of the FLUXNET2015 dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multiple imputation (MI) strategy based on an efficient computational strategy introduced in Honaker and King (2010), combining the classic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a bootstrap approach, in order to take draws from a suitable approximation of posterior distribution of model parameters. Armed with these instruments, we are able to introduce three new multiple imputation models, characterized by an increasing level of complexity, and built on top of multivariate normality assumption: 1) MLR, which imputes EC missing values using a static multiple linear regression of observed values of suitable input variables; 2) ADL, which enriches with dynamic properties the static specification of MLR, by considering an autoregressive distributed lag specification; 3) PADL, which adds further complexity by embedding the ADL model in a panel-data perspective. Under several artificial gap scenarios, we show that PADL has a better ability in modeling the complex dynamics of ecosystem fluxes and reconstructing missing data points, thus providing unbiased imputations and preserving the original sampling distribution. The added flexibility arising from the time series cross section structure of PADL warrants improved performances, outperforming those of other imputation methods, as well as of the marginal distribution sampling algorithm (MDS), a widely used gapfilling approach introduced by Reichstein et al. (2005), especially in the case of nighttime flux data. It is expected that the strategy proposed in this paper will become useful in creating multiple imputations for a variety of EC datasets, providing valid inferences for a broad range of scientific estimands (such as annual budgets).},

This work contributes to overcoming such challenges by introducing an innovative strategy for EC data cleaning. The proposed strategy includes a set of tests aimed at detecting the presence of specific sources of systematic error, as well as an outlier detection procedure aimed at identifying aberrant flux values. Results from tests and outlier detection are integrated in such a way as to leave a large degree of flexibility in the choice of tests and of test threshold values, ensuring scalability of the whole process. The selection of best performing tests was carried out by means of Monte Carlo experiments, whereas the impact on real data was evaluated on data distributed by the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) research infrastructure. Results evidenced that the proposed procedure leads to an effective cleaning of EC flux data, avoiding the use of subjective criteria in the decision rule that specifies whether to retain or reject flux data of dubious quality. We expect that the proposed data cleaning procedure can serve as a basis towards a unified quality control strategy for EC datasets, in particular in centralized data processing pipelines where the use of robust and automated routines ensuring results reproducibility constitutes an essential prerequisite.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Currently, the FLUXNET database contains more than 500 registered sites, and up to 250 of them share data (free fair-use data set). Many modelling groups use the FLUXNET data set for evaluating ecosystem models' performance, but this requires uninterrupted time series for the meteorological variables used as input. Because original in situ data often contain gaps, from very short (few hours) up to relatively long (some months) ones, we develop a new and robust method for filling the gaps in meteorological data measured at site level. Our approach has the benefit of making use of continuous data available globally (ERA-Interim) and a high temporal resolution spanning from 1989 to today. These data are, however, not measured at site level, and for this reason a method to downscale and correct the ERA-Interim data is needed. We apply this method to the level 4 data (L4) from the La Thuile collection, freely available after registration under a fair-use policy. The performance of the developed method varies across sites and is also function of the meteorological variable. On average over all sites, applying the bias correction method to the ERA-Interim data reduced the mismatch with the in situ data by 10 to 36 \%, depending on the meteorological variable considered. In comparison to the internal variability of the in situ data, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the in situ data and the unbiased ERA-I (ERA-Interim) data remains relatively large (on average over all sites, from 27 to 76 \% of the standard deviation of in situ data, depending on the meteorological variable considered). The performance of the method remains poor for the wind speed field, in particular regarding its capacity to conserve a standard deviation similar to the one measured at FLUXNET stations. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The ERA-Interim reanalysis data de-biased at FLUXNET sites can be downloaded from the PANGAEA data centre ({$<$}a href="http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.838234" target="\_blank"{$>$}http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.838234{$<$}/a{$>$}).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, MOD17A2H GPP was assessed using the latest eddy covariance (EC) flux data (FLUXNET2015 Dataset) at eighteen sites in six ecosystems across the globe. The sensitivity of MOD17A2H GPP to the meteorology dataset and the fractional photosynthetically- active radiation (FPAR) product was explored by introducing site meteorology observations and improved Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) products. The results showed that MOD17A2H GPP underestimated flux-derived GPP at most sites. Its performance in estimating annual GPP was poor (R2 = 0.62) and even worse over eight days (R2 = 0.52). For the MOD17A2H algorithm, replacing the reanalysis meteorological datasets with the site meteorological measurements failed to improve the estimation accuracies. However, great improvements in estimating the site-based GPP were gained by replacing MODIS FPAR with GLASS FPAR. This indicated that in the existing MOD17A2H product, the errors were originated more from FPAR than the meteorological data. We further examined the potential error contributions from land cover classification and maximum light use efficiency ({$\epsilon$}max). It was found that the current land cover classification scheme exhibited frequent misclassification errors. Moreover, the {$\epsilon$}max value assigned in MOD17A2H was much smaller than the inferred {$\epsilon$}max value. Therefore, the qualities of FPAR and land cover classification datasets should be upgraded, and the {$\epsilon$}max value needs to be adjusted to provide more accurate GPP estimates using MOD17A2H for global ecosystems.},

Japanese fir populations near the F1NPP showed a significantly increased number of morphological defects, involving deletions of leader shoots of the main axis, compared to a control population far from the F1NPP. The frequency of the defects corresponded to the radioactive contamination levels of the observation sites. A significant increase in deletions of the leader shoots became apparent in those that elongated after the spring of 2012, a year after the accident.

The sites represent Douglas-fir forest ecosystems at two contrasting successional stages: old-growth (OG) and early seral (ES). Here we present eddy flux and meteorological data from two early seral stands and the Wind River AmeriFlux old-growth forest during the growing season (March\textendash October) in 2006 and 2007. We show an alternative approach to the usual friction velocity (u*) method for determining periods of adequate atmospheric boundary layer mixing based on the ratio of mean horizontal (U) or vertical (w\textasciimacron ) wind flow to a modified turbulent kinetic energy scale (uTKE). This new parameter in addition to footprint modeling showed that daytime CO2 fluxes (FNEE) in small clear-cuts ({$<$}10ha) can be measured accurately with EC if micrometeorological conditions are carefully evaluated. Peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE=-14.0 to -12.3{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) at OG were measured in April in both 2006 and 2007 before bud break when air and soil temperatures and vapor pressure deficit were relatively low, and soil moisture and light levels were favorable for photosynthesis. At the early seral stands, peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE=-11.0 to -8.7{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) were measured in June and July while spring-time CO2 fluxes were much smaller (FNEE=-3.8 to -3.6{$\mu$}molm-2s-1). Overall, we measured lower evapotranspiration (OG=230mm, ES=297mm), higher midday FNEE (OG FNEE=-9.0{$\mu$}molm-2s-1, ES FNEE=-7.3{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) and higher Bowen ratios (OG {$\beta$}=2.0, ES {$\beta$}=1.2) at the old-growth forest than at the ES sites during the summer months (May\textendash August).

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) methodology over three adjacent evergreen forests in southern Washington State to identify stand-level age-effects on ecosystem exchange. The sites represent Douglas-fir forest ecosystems at two contrasting successional stages: old-growth (OG) and early seral (ES). Here we present eddy flux and meteorological data from two early seral stands and the Wind River AmeriFlux old-growth forest during the growing season (March\textendash October) in 2006 and 2007. We show an alternative approach to the usual friction velocity (u*) method for determining periods of adequate atmospheric boundary layer mixing based on the ratio of mean horizontal (U) or vertical (w\textasciimacron ) wind flow to a modified turbulent kinetic energy scale (uTKE). This new parameter in addition to footprint modeling showed that daytime CO2 fluxes (FNEE) in small clear-cuts ({$<$}10ha) can be measured accurately with EC if micrometeorological conditions are carefully evaluated. Peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE=-14.0 to -12.3{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) at OG were measured in April in both 2006 and 2007 before bud break when air and soil temperatures and vapor pressure deficit were relatively low, and soil moisture and light levels were favorable for photosynthesis. At the early seral stands, peak midday CO2 fluxes (FNEE=-11.0 to -8.7{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) were measured in June and July while spring-time CO2 fluxes were much smaller (FNEE=-3.8 to -3.6{$\mu$}molm-2s-1). Overall, we measured lower evapotranspiration (OG=230mm, ES=297mm), higher midday FNEE (OG FNEE=-9.0{$\mu$}molm-2s-1, ES FNEE=-7.3{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) and higher Bowen ratios (OG {$\beta$}=2.0, ES {$\beta$}=1.2) at the old-growth forest than at the ES sites during the summer months (May\textendash August). Eddy covariance studies such as ours add critical land-atmosphere exchange data for an abundant, but rarely studied Douglas-fir age class.},

  abstract = {Habitat destruction and the resultant fragmentation of the remaining forest are a common phenomenon in the tropics. Most investigations emphasize the potential dangers of fragmentation in isolating patches of forest and exposing populations to loss of species diversity through founder effects, genetic drift, inbreeding, and restricted gene flow. However, a limited number of studies have shown that gene flow may be extensive in tropical trees, suggesting that it may occur between forest fragments and also ``isolated'' remnant trees. There is an urgent need to quantify pollen flow within and between forest fragments to test the veracity of such views and determine the genetic value of such fragments for in situ conservation. Microsatellite markers are used to genotype individuals of Swietenia humilis from a highly fragmented forest mosaic to directly quantify pollen-mediated gene flow. Distances of pollen flow more than 10 times greater than previously reported were detected. Our results show that some tropical angiosperm tree species may be much more adaptable and resilient to habitat destruction and fragmentation than previously considered. The description of many remnant trees as isolated or ``living dead'' may be more a conditioning of human perception than a true reflection of their potential conservation value.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} There is a growing consensus that land surface models (LSMs) that simulate terrestrial biosphere exchanges of matter and energy must be better constrained with data to quantify and address their uncertainties. FLUXNET, an international network of sites that measure the land surface exchanges of carbon, water and energy using the eddy covariance technique, is a prime source of data for model improvement. Here we outline a multi-stage process for "fusing" (i.e. linking) LSMs with FLUXNET data to generate better models with quantifiable uncertainty. First, we describe FLUXNET data availability, and its random and systematic biases. We then introduce methods for assessing LSM model runs against FLUXNET observations in temporal and spatial domains. These assessments are a prelude to more formal model-data fusion (MDF). MDF links model to data, based on error weightings. In theory, MDF produces optimal analyses of the modelled system, but there are practical problems. We first discuss how to set model errors and initial conditions. In both cases incorrect assumptions will affect the outcome of the MDF. We then review the problem of equifinality, whereby multiple combinations of parameters can produce similar model output. Fusing multiple independent and orthogonal data provides a means to limit equifinality. We then show how parameter probability density functions (PDFs) from MDF can be used to interpret model validity, and to propagate errors into model outputs. Posterior parameter distributions are a useful way to assess the success of MDF, combined with a determination of whether model residuals are Gaussian. If the MDF scheme provides evidence for temporal variation in parameters, then that is indicative of a critical missing dynamic process. A comparison of parameter PDFs generated with the same model from multiple FLUXNET sites can provide insights into the concept and validity of plant functional types (PFT) \textendash{} we would expect similar parameter estimates among sites sharing a single PFT. We conclude by identifying five major model-data fusion challenges for the FLUXNET and LSM communities: (1) to determine appropriate use of current data and to explore the information gained in using longer time series; (2) to avoid confounding effects of missing process representation on parameter estimation; (3) to assimilate more data types, including those from earth observation; (4) to fully quantify uncertainties arising from data bias, model structure, and initial conditions problems; and (5) to carefully test current model concepts (e.g. PFTs) and guide development of new concepts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Their behaviors, such as foraging, bioenergetics, interactions with conspecifics, and reproduction, as well as spatial movements, are modeled separately for each bird. The individual behavior of each bird is described by decision rules which specify what particular action the bird performs at any given time. The paper gives an overview of the most important behavioral rules used in the model and also briefly describes how the physical and resource environments are taken into account.

The EGM is negatively correlated with latitude, and it decreases by 1 mo for every 11{$\mdsmwhtcircle$} increase in latitude. There is no evidence of a difference in the EGM between Australia and Africa, but, latitude for latitude, Australia and Africa have a mean EGM 1.9 mo longer than elsewhere.

This is particularly challenging in heterogeneous regions such as the northern forests of the United States. We use a network of 17 eddy covariance flux towers deployed across the Upper Midwest region of northern Wisconsin and Michigan and upscale flux observations from towers to the regional scale. This region is densely instrumented and provides a unique test bed for regional upscaling. We develop a simple Diagnostic Carbon Flux Model (DCFM) and use flux observations and a data assimilation approach to estimate the model parameters. We then use the optimized model to produce gridded flux estimates across the region. We find that model parameters vary not only across plant functional types (PFT) but also within a given PFT. Our results show that the parameter estimates from a single site are not representative of the parameter values of a given PFT; cross-site (or joint) optimization using observations from multiple sites encompassing a range of site and climate conditions considerably improves the representativeness and robustness of parameter estimates. Parameter variability within a PFT can result in substantial variability in regional flux estimates. We also find that land cover representation including land cover heterogeneity and the spatial resolution and accuracy of land cover maps can lead to considerable uncertainty in regional flux estimates. In heterogeneous, complex regions, detailed and accurate land cover maps are essential for accurate estimation of regional fluxes.},

Due to the limitation of field meteorological observation conditions, observation data are commonly missing, and an appropriate data imputation method is necessary in meteorological data applications. In this paper, we focus on filling long gaps in meteorological observation data at field sites. A deep learning-based model, BiLSTM-I, is proposed to impute missing half-hourly temperature observations with high accuracy by considering temperature observations obtained manually at a low frequency. An encoder-decoder structure is adopted by BiLSTM-I, which is conducive to fully learning the potential distribution pattern of data. In addition, the BiLSTM-I model error function incorporates the difference between the final estimates and true observations. Therefore, the error function evaluates the imputation results more directly, and the model convergence error and the imputation accuracy are directly related, thus ensuring that the imputation error can be minimized at the time the model converges. The experimental analysis results show that the BiLSTM-I model designed in this paper is superior to other methods. For a test set with a time interval gap of 30 days, or a time interval gap of 60 days, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) remain stable, indicating the model's excellent generalization ability for different missing value gaps. Although the model is only applied to temperature data imputation in this study, it also has the potential to be applied to other meteorological dataset-filling scenarios.},

  abstract = {Understanding the lagged effect of drought on photosynthesis is essential in global climate change research. Various gross primary productivity (GPP) datasets have been used to assess the drought effect on photosynthesis. However, discrepancies have been found in these GPP datasets, and whether the GPP discrepancies can cause uncertainties in understanding the lagged effect of drought on photosynthesis remains unclear. Here, twenty-six global GPP datasets from light use efficiency (LUE)-, machine learning (ML)-, and process-based models during 2001\textendash 2010, were used to evaluate the role of GPP discrepancies in characterizing the lagged effect of drought on photosynthesis. Based on probability analysis, a relatively reliable pattern about the lagged effect of drought on global photosynthesis was derived from multiple GPP datasets. Results showed that these 26 GPP datasets existed obvious discrepancies across the globe, with a standard deviation (SD) value of 42~g C m-2 month-1. Moreover, the area presenting the lagged effect of drought on photosynthesis was found to range between 32\% and 69\% of the global vegetated lands, confirming the obvious differences in drought patterns derived from different GPP datasets. Our results also indicated that the tropical region (20\textdegree N\textendash 20\textdegree S) presented lower reliabilities of lagged effect than other regions, indicating that the assessment of drought effect on photosynthesis in the tropical region should be more cautious. Furthermore, the probability-based lagged effect of drought on global photosynthesis showed that the lagged effect of drought on photosynthesis existed in 50\% of the vegetated lands, with dominant lagged months being less than 8~months, suggesting that the water deficiency in preceding months probably influences vegetation growth. Our study highlights the need to better constrain the carbon modelling under tropical climate and demonstrates that uncertainties caused by GPP datasets should be considered when assessing drought effect on photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {For the real-world time series analysis, data missing is a ubiquitously existing problem due to anomalies during data collecting and storage. If not treated properly, this problem will seriously hinder the classification, regression, or related tasks. Existing methods for time series imputation either impose too strong assumptions on the distribution of missing data or cannot fully exploit, even simply ignore, the informative temporal dependencies and feature correlations across different time steps. In this article, inspired by the idea of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose a generative adversarial learning framework for time series imputation under the condition of observed data (as well as the labels, if possible). In our model, we employ a modified bidirectional RNN structure as the generator G, which is aimed at generating the missing values by taking advantage of the temporal and nontemporal information extracted from the observed time series. The discriminator D is designed to distinguish whether each value in a time series is generated or not so that it can help the generator to make an adjustment toward a more authentic imputation result. For an empirical verification of our model, we conduct imputation and classification experiments on several real-world time series data sets. The experimental results show an eminent improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract = {Application of remote sensing data to extrapolate evapotranspiration (ET) measured at eddy covariance flux towers is a potentially powerful method to estimate continental-scale ET. In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and an inductive machine learning technique called support vector machine (SVM) to develop a predictive ET model. The model was then applied to the conterminous U.S. In this process, we first trained the SVM to predict 2000\textendash 2002 ET measurements from 25 AmeriFlux sites using three remotely sensed variables [land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover] and one ground-measured variable (surface shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated the model performance by predicting ET for 19 flux sites in 2003. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted ET with a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.62 mm/day (approximately 23\% of the mean observed values) and an\$R\^2\$of 0.75. The rmse from SVM was significantly smaller than that from neural network and multiple-regression approaches in a cross-validation experiment. Among the explanatory variables, EVI was the most important factor. Indeed, removing this variable induced an rmse increase from 0.54 to 0.77 mm/day. Third, with forcings from remote sensing data alone, we used the SVM model to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of ET for the conterminous U.S. for 2004. The SVM model captured the spatial and temporal variations of ET at a continental scale.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a ubiquitous problem. It is especially challenging in medical settings because many streams of measurements are collected at different \textendash{} and often irregular \textendash{} times. Accurate estimation of those missing measurements is critical for many reasons, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Existing methods address this estimation problem by interpolating within data streams or imputing across data streams (both of which ignore important information) or ignoring the temporal aspect of the data and imposing strong assumptions about the nature of the data-generating process and/or the pattern of missing data (both of which are especially problematic for medical data). We propose a new approach, based on a novel deep learning architecture that we call a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN) that interpolates within data streams and imputes across data streams. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to five real-world medical datasets. We show that it provides dramatically improved estimation of missing measurements in comparison to 11 state-of-the-art benchmarks (including Spline and Cubic Interpolations, MICE, MissForest, matrix completion and several RNN methods); typical improvements in Root Mean Square Error are between 35\% - 50\%. Additional experiments based on the same five datasets demonstrate that the improvements provided by our method are extremely robust.},

Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional noisy spiking activity in a compact denoised form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the data are firstdenoised'' by smoothing over time, then a static dimensionality reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way, and account for spiking variability that may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that GPFA provided a better characterization of the population activity than the two-stage methods. From the extracted single-trial neural trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect suggestive of attractor dynamics that was shown indirectly by previous studies.},

Selected plots included the two most representative overstory species (Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L.) in combination with the most representative understory species of the forest. A model that includes temperature and water as the main controlling variables was fitted to the data. We found large spatial variability in SR among plots, with typically lower fluxes under the coniferous overstory than under the deciduous overstory (means of 4.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 and 8.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 Mg C ha-1 year-1, respectively). Total annual soil carbon (C) emissions were estimated by weighting fluxes from different types of vegetation according to their relative contribution to the footprint area of the eddy covariance flux measurement. The relative contribution of the two main tree species to the footprint-weighted total SR varied among seasons with the more abundant coniferous overstory contributing the most to total SR during most of the year. Nonetheless, during summer, the contribution of deciduous plots to total SR was disproportionally high because of the more pronounced seasonality of belowground metabolic activity. Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange was measured by eddy covariance, and we estimated total ecosystem respiration (TER) with footprint-constrained nighttime fluxes. Mean total annual SR and TER were 6.1 {$\pm$} 0.11 and 9.1 {$\pm$} 1.15 Mg C ha-1 year-1, respectively. The 95\% confidence interval of the ratio of annual SR:TER ranged from 0.58 to 0.76, with a mean of 0.67. The contribution of SR to TER tended to vary seasonally, with minimum contributions during summer (less than 50\% of TER) and maximum contributions during winter (about 94\% of TER).},

Studying desert plant communities is particularly challenging because of strong intra- and interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Models rise to this challenge by providing an arena for systematic evaluation of the parameter space in virtual experiments. We applied a trait- and individual-based model to explore how community dynamics arise from the plant traits and interactions of plants with other plants and with their environment. The model is based on data from annual plant communities in the Negev Desert dominated by the True Rose of Jericho (Anastatica hierochuntica). We showed that functional traits that are involved in plant-plant interactions are equally important for community dynamics as traits promoting tolerance to abiotic stress. The sensitivity analysis of the model highlights relative growth rate, maximum biomass, the amount of time in dormancy and germination probability as the most important traits for community dynamics. The model reflects the particular importance of environmental factors such as precipitation and soil water availability based on topography for community dynamics. Our model benefits from the ability of individual-based models to capture plant-plant interactions and derive community properties from individual characteristics and from the feature of trait-based approaches to link traits to organismal functions. Our study demonstrates the advantages of the combined use of trait- and individual-based models for investigating community drivers in changing extreme environments.},

A comprehensive evaluation on these products is necessary for selecting the most suitable ET products and developing large-scale ET models step forward. In this study, the accuracy and uncertainty of five RS-based global ET products (MOD16, SSEBop, GLEAM, AVHRR, and BESS) were evaluated at multi scales. At point scale their accuracy was evaluated through a direct comparison with in-situ observations from 94 worldwide flux towers. Results indicate that accuracy differences of these five products vary with statistical metrics and land cover types. The combination of all statistics illustrates that GLEAM and AVHRR outperform three other products, which is consistent with the findings of most previous continental-scale studies. The accuracy at basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big river basins. BESS is found to be the product that is superior to four other ET products at both monthly and multi-annual scale, which may be related with its low random error at point scale. The uncertainty of these five products at pixel scale was assessed by the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and comparison analysis. The TCH outputs reveal that BESS and SSEBop are the two products with the lowest and largest relative uncertainty, respectively. That explains the good performance of BESS at basin scale from another perspective. As for the two MODIS-based ET products (MOD16 and SSEBop), their accuracy at FLUXNET site scale is comparable in monthly ET estimation. However, SSEBop has special advantage in the capture of multiyear ET patterns. The comparison analysis indicates that SSEBop is the product that agrees best with the ensemble mean not only on a global scale but also in four of the six continents. Our results imply that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best ET product in all respects. The selection of ET products for scientific research should consider their performance difference in spatial scale as well as the influence of land cover and climate conditions.},

Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{3}, and CO\textsubscript{2}. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16\textendash 19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO\textsubscript{2}, CO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{3}) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 \% relative error), 10 ppm for CO\textsubscript{2} (2 \% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO\textsubscript{2} (29 \% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O\textsubscript{3} (15 \% relative error), and Pearson \emph{r} versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO\textsubscript{2} and CO\textsubscript{2}. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO\textsubscript{2} concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
