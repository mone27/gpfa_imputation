\section*{Abstract}

Eddy Covariance (EC) is a state-of-the-art technique to measure greenhouse gases exchanges. EC towers include measurement of meteorological variables, but due to instrument failures the data is no always available. Many use cases of EC data, especially Land Surface Models, require continuous meteorological time series as input. Therefore, it is necessary to impute the gaps in the meteorological time series. ONEFlux, one of the most widely used EC post-processing pipelines, imputes the missing data using either Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS), which uses other observations from similar meteorological conditions, or ERA-Interim (ERA-I), that is a global meteorological dataset. The imputation performance of those methods is limited for short and medium gaps (up to 1 week), which represent the majority of EC meteorological gaps.

In this work, I assess an imputation method for meteorological variables based on a Kalman Filter (KF). It has the advantages of combining in the prediction information from the ERA-I dataset, inter-variable correlation and  temporal autocorrelation. Moreover, the KF is a probabilistic method, so for each data point the prediction is not a single value but an entire distribution, which provides an interpretable quantification of uncertainty of the model prediction.

I evaluate the Kalman Filter by  comparing the imputation performance with the state-of-the-art approaches (MDS and ERA-I) using data from the FLUXNET site of Hainich (DE-Hai) with gaps up to one week long. The KF outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across all analysed variables, except for precipitation, for which all methods are comparable. I observed an average reduction of the imputation error of 33 \% compared to ERA-I and  57 \% compared to MDS, when excluding precipitation. I further explore aspects that influence the performance of the KF: in general the error increases with the gap length only up to 24 hours, the use of ERA-I data improves the model predictions and the inter-variable correlation is effectively utilized.
The main limitations of KF approach are: 1) the best performance is achieved only when fine-tuning of the model parameters to the specific conditions of the gap, which increases the deployment complexity; 2) The current implantation of the KF is affected by numerical stability issue, which in case all variables are missing limits the maximum gap length to 15 hours; 3) careful initialization of the KF parameters and selection of the training conditions are required to mitigate the difficulty in learning the models parameters. 

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{State of the art}
\paragraph{Eddy Covariance} Eddy Covariance (EC) is a state-of-the-art technique for measuring greenhouse gases and energy exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere \cite{aubinet_eddy_2012-1}.  The technique allows for non-destructive measurements at the ecosystem level with a high temporal resolution (30 minutes). EC data is used for ecological and physiological research of ecosystems, for example to estimate the relation of forest age and carbon balance \cite{besnard_quantifying_2018} or the effects of extreme events \cite{mahecha_detecting_2017}. In addition, EC data is a key element of the validation and calibration of validation of ecosystem process models and remote sensing observations \cite{papale_ideas_2020}.
The core of EC technique a site is the 3D anemometer and a gas analyser, which allows estimating the fluxes of interests (e.g. \ce{CO_2}, \ce{H_2O}, \ce{CH_4}). Beside the fluxes, an Eddy Covariance setup commonly comprises measurements of meteorological variables and ecosystem parameters. This additional data provides the context to use and interpret the fluxes measurements.

\paragraph{Gaps in meteorological variables} The acquisition of the meteorological variables can be interrupted by failures in the instruments or power outages, resulting in gaps in the time series \cite{aubinet_eddy_2012-1}.
The presence of meteorological gaps is a problem for several uses of the EC data.

An important use case of EC is the validation of Land Surface Models \cite{balzarolo_evaluating_2014, friend_fluxnet_2007-1, bonan_improving_2011-1, kramer_evaluation_2002}, which are process based model that estimate fluxes and include meteorological conditions as inputs. The errors of Land Surface Models deriving from inaccuracies in the input are comparable to the errors arising from the limitation in the models formulations \cite{zhao_how_2012}. 
Secondly, meteorological observations are used as a driver to impute gaps in the fluxes measurements \cite{aubinet_eddy_2012-1}, which in turn requires complete meteorological time series.
Finally, if the observations are aggregated, for example to compute the weekly average of meteorological conditions, the missing data leads to inaccurate results. 

The described use cases highlight the need for high quality continuous meteorological measurement that reflect the condition at the EC station. Redundant instruments and power supply on the site, reduce the amount of missing data. However, even a redundant system is subject to failures, so statistical models are used for imputing the remaining gaps \cite{aubinet_eddy_2012-1}.

\paragraph{Imputation approaches} In general there are three approaches to obtain information on missing values in a multivariate time series and thus impute the missing data: 1) use other observations of the missing variable to make predictions about the gap, in particular the variable \emph{temporal autocorrelation} can be exploited to reconstruct the missing data \cite{moritz_comparison_nodate}; 2) use \emph{statistical dependency} between variables, if not all variables are missing then the correlation between variables can be used for imputing the missing variable \cite{moffat_comprehensive_2007}; 3) use \emph{other independent measurements}, if another compatible and continuous time series is available they can be used for imputation \cite{vuichard_filling_2015}. For instance, in the case of EC meteorological variables, an independent time series can be obtained from a nearby meteorological station or a weather model reanalysis. 

Imputation of missing values has been extensively researched and a wide range of methods have been developed, ranging from simply replacing with the mean to more advanced approaches employing deep neural networks \cite{moritz_r_2017, fang_time_2020-1, buuren_mice_2011, du_saits_2022-1, zhang_dual-head_2021-2, cao_brits_nodate}. There exist several methods specifically developed to impute meteorological time series \cite{costa_gap_2021, jing_multi-imputation_2022}. However, those methods cannot be directly employed as imputation in the EC data has some specific characteristics: the absence of a spatial component (EC sites are too distant from each other), the high temporal resolution and the relatively high number of variables. 

\paragraph{Current method imputation EC community} EC post-processing pipeline impute meteorological time series. Arguably the most widely used post-processing pipeline is \textsf{ONEFlux} \cite{pastorello_fluxnet2015_2020}, which is adopted by several large networks such as FLUXNET, the global EC network, ICOS the European network as well as AmeriFlux, the American EC network.
ONEFlux uses two different methods for imputing the meteorological data: Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS) and ERA-Interim (ERA-I). The final gap-filled meteorological product uses either MDS or ERA-I, depending on the quality flag of MDS.
\paragraph{MDS} Marginal Distribution Sampling \cite{reichstein_separation_2005-3} imputes the missing value by using the average of all the other data points observed in similar conditions. The similarity is both temporal, only observations from a limited time window around the gap are considered, and meteorological, the data points are restricted to times when other variables are similar. 
The algorithm selects all the data points where the value of the driver variables (other meteorological variables) is within a fixed threshold of the one observed at the missing data point. All the observations of the variables of interest from the selected data points are then averaged to generate the filling value. MDS starts with a time window of 7 days and if no similar conditions are found in this time frame the window is progressively increased. If a driver variable is also missing it is not used in the selection of similar conditions. 
In case no similar conditions are found in a time window of 14 days or all drivers are missing, the MDS fails and the imputation is done using the average value at the same time of the day. For gaps longer than 140 days the algorithm cannot impute the gap.
MDS imputes each data point and each variable separately. It mainly uses statical dependency between variables and in a limited way the variable temporal autocorrelation. 

The algorithm implemented in \textsf{ONEFlux} uses as drivers the incoming shortwave radiation (\texttt{SW\_IN}), air temperature (\texttt{TA}) and Vapour pressure deficit (\texttt{VPD}). If either \texttt{TA} or \texttt{VPD} is missing, \texttt{SW\_IN} is used as the only driver. 
MDS has a quality flag with 3 possible values (i.e. 1,2,3) that depends on the size of the time window. In \textsf{ONEFlux} MDS is used only if the quality flag is 1, which in general means that similar conditions are found in a time window smaller than 14 days (see figure A1 in  \textcite{reichstein_separation_2005-3} for details). 

\paragraph{ERA-Interim} ERA-Interim (ERA-I) is a global meteorological dataset provided by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) \cite{dee_era-interim_2011}. Weather forecast models are used to reanalyse past observations and produce a continuous and complete dataset for the entire globe. The main drawback is the low spatial resolution and temporal resolution, that are respectively 80km and 3 hours. Moreover, only a subset of the meteorological variables are available in ERA-I (see table \ref{table:variables}) and the data is not available in real-time but with a 3 months delay.

In order to use the ERA-I in the EC context, the observations have to be temporally downscaled to match the half-hourly frequency of EC data. Furthermore, the performance of ERA-I imputation can be improved by removing the systematic bias for each site. Both steps are performed in \textsf{ONEFlux} as described in \cite{vuichard_filling_2015}. The error correction is performed using a different linear regression for each site and each variable.

The accuracy of the ERA-I imputation is independent of the length of the gap. This is advantageous for long gaps, as ERA-I data includes long-term evolution of the weather, which is not possible to predict by only analysing the local time series. At the same time, for short gaps, the local conditions can provide a more  accurate prediction.
In fact, \textsf{ONEFlux} imputes the short gaps using MDS and long gaps with ERA-I.

\paragraph{Other methods} Beyond \textsf{ONEFlux}, there are several other established EC post-processing pipelines which impute meteorological data. However, the imputation approaches in other libraries, like \textsf{REddyProc} \cite{wutzler_basic_2018} or \textsf{OzFlux} \cite{isaac_ozflux_2017} are similar. \textsf{REddyProc} employs only MDS for the imputation, while \textsf{OzFlux} uses both MDS and ERA-I. In addition, OzFlux also includes data from the Australian Weather Service (AWS) and for each gap it utilizes either ERA-I or AWS, depending on which dataset has the smallest error in a time window of 90 days around the gap.

\subsection{Potential for improvement}


\begin{figure}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth]{timeseries_sota.pdf}}
\caption{ Timeseries}
\label{fig:ts_sota}
\end{figure}

The imputation quality of the current methods is sometimes limited (Figure \ref{fig:ts_sota}). In particular, the imputation using MDS often results in relatively high error and unrealistic patterns. There are two possible directions to improve the accuracy of the imputation:  make a better use of temporal autocorrelation of the variables; combine the information from ERA-I data and variables correlation for every prediction, instead of using the two approaches independently. Moreover, the current methods do not provide a measure of the uncertainty of the predictions.

\paragraph{Temporal autocorrelation} MDS uses the temporal autocorrelation only in a limited way, as it takes the average of the missing variable across the whole time window and does not weight the data depending on the proximity to the gap.  Similarly, the bias correction in ERA-I uses the entire dataset from a site, thus more importance is not assigned to the conditions around the gap.  This is a suboptimal use of available data, as the observations close to the gap have the highest correlation with the data in the gap and the meteorological variables have an overall high temporal autocorrelation. This is particularly relevant for short and medium gaps (shorter than 1 week), which are the majority in the EC context.
In FLUXNET 2015 \cite{pastorello_fluxnet2015_2020}, the most extensive EC dataset with over 200 sites, almost 99 \% of gaps of meteorological variables are shorter than a week (appendix Figure \ref{fig:gap_len_dist}).

\paragraph{Combination of imputation approaches} ONEFlux employs both ERA-I and MDS, but the two methods are used independently, not combined to improve the predictions. The criteria to select the method to use is only the MDS quality control flags. The information on the missing data from temporal autocorrelation, correlation with other variables and other measurements can be combined to make a more accurate prediction.

\paragraph{Uncertainty} A limitation of the current methods is the lack of a robust assessment of the uncertainty of the imputed values. MDS has a quality flag, but it is limited to only 3 possible values and it derives from constant thresholds. Moreover, in the final ONEFlux product, the quality flag indicates only which gap filling method has been used. Ideally, each predicted data point has an associated uncertainty, which varies continuously and is interpretable, with the same physical units of the variable.  In this way, the level of confidence of the model in each prediction is available to the data user. The uncertainty can be used either to discard the data above a custom threshold, which can change depending on the application, or to directly include it in the downstream calculations.

\subsection{Contribution of this work}
For this work, I focused on methods that combine all three imputation approaches and include interpretable quantification of uncertainty. Probabilistic machine learning algorithms are particularly suited, as they directly provide an interpretability uncertainty.
Gaussian Processes (GP) are one of the most important probabilistic algorithms \cite{2020_hennig_pml}. GP can model interactions between all data points, for example they can consider both a yearly and a daily pattern in the data. This, however, is connected to their main drawback: the computation cost scales cubically with the number of observations, making the use of GP computationally prohibitive. To overcome this limitation, several approximations, such as sparse GP, have been developed. 
The Kalman Filter (KF) can be viewed as a special kind of GP, which models the time at discrete steps and where all the information about past and future observations is stored in a latent state. This drastically improves the computation efficiency, which scales linearly in the number of observations, but limits the ability to model processes with long time scales. However, in the context of EC meteorological imputation, this is an acceptable tradeoff as the majority of gaps are not long. Another advantage of the KF is the ability to include the ERA-I data in the predictions.

The aim of this work is to develop and test an imputation method for meteorological time series in the context of EC that employs a Kalman Filter, as it promises more accurate predictions through a more efficient use of temporal autocorrelation and the inclusion of ERA-I data. Moreover, the KF provides a quantification of the predictions' uncertainty.
The imputation performance of the Kalman Filter is evaluated by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods (ERA-I and MDS). Then the aspects that affect the performance of the KF are assessed: the impact of the length of the gap, the advantage of including ERA-I data, the importance of statistical dependency between variables and different training scenarios. The data from the EC site of Hainich, Germany, was used to train and evaluate the model.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Kalman Filter Theory}

Kalman Filter models over time a latent variable $x$, that represents the state of the system. The state cannot be directly observed, but it is possible to observe meteorological variables $y$ that reflect the state of the system. 
Kalman Filter is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, so it keeps track of the entire distribution of the latent variable \cite{bishop_pattern_2006}.
The KF can update the state also when there are missing observations, hence the state is available for all time steps, which can be used to predict the missing data points.

In order to model the state over time, assumptions on the behaviour of the system are made. The first element is to model the time as a discrete variable.  Then there are three key assumptions: 1) the states are connected by a Markov chain, which means that the state at time $t$ depends only on the state at time $t-1$ and not on the states at previous times $p(x_t|x_{t-1}) = p(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \hdots, x_0)$ 2) the value of the observed variable depends on the latent state 3) all the relationships are linear and all distributions are Gaussian. Additionally, the mean of the state at time $t$ may also depend on an external control variable $c_t$. This control variable does not depend on the state of the models, but provides information on the change of the state mean.
Equations \ref{eq:system_state} and \ref{eq:system_obs} describe the assumptions on the behaviour of the system:

\begin{align}
p(x_t | x_{t-1}) &= \norm{x_t}{Ax_{t-1} + d + Bc}{Q} \label{eq:system_state}\\
p(y_t | x_t) &= \norm{y_t}{Hx_t + b}{R} \label{eq:system_obs}
\end{align}

The probability distributions of the state are computed using Bayesian inference. The computational cost of probabilistic inference is drastically reduced in this context, as can be performed using only linear algebra operations since all the relations are linear and all distributions are Gaussian.

The aim of the Kalman Filter is to compute for every data point the missing observations, $\hat{y}^g_t$, the probability distribution given all the other observations, $Y^{ng}$, and the control variable, $C$: $p(\hat{y}^g_t \mid Y^{ng}, C$. In order to achieve this, intermediate probability distributions are computed by in successive step. 
The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:kalman_filter}), where the same set of operations are repeated for every time $t$. The first step is to compute the conditional distribution of the state given all observations until time $t-1$: $p(x_t \mid Y_{1:t-1})$.

Then the observation at time is $t$, $y_t$, is used to update the distribution of state by computing $p(x_t \mid Y_{1:})$. Observations can be partially or totally missing.
These two steps are iteratively repeated for every time in the observed dataset, starting from time $0$.
The final step is to update the distribution of the state by using also the observations after time $t$ and computing for every $t$ $p(x_t|Y)$. This step is performed iteratively starting from the last time step.


The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:kalman_filter}).
The first step is to compute the \textit{predicted state}, $x^-_t$, is obtained from the previous state ($x_{t-1}$) and the \textit{control variable} ($c_t$). This represents the conditional distribution of the state, given all observations until time $t-1$, $Y^{ng}_{0:t-1}$ and the control variable until time $t$, $C_{0:t}$. $p(x_t \mid Y^{ng}_{0:t-1}, C_{0:t})$.
The second step is to update the predicted state using the \textit{observation} at time $t$, $y_t$, to obtain the \textit{filtered state}, $x^f_t$. Observations can be partially or totally missing. This is the conditional distribution of the state given all the observation until time $t$: $p(x_t \mid Y^{ng}_{1:t-1}, C_{0:t})$.
These two steps make the filtering pass of the KF and are iteratively repeated for every time step in the observed dataset, starting from time $0$.

The last operation is to compute the smoothed state, which is obtained by updating the filtered state using the information from the observations after time $t$. This computes the conditional distribution of the state given all the observations and control variables: $p(x_t \mid Y^{ng}_{1:t-1}, C)$.

Finally, for all the time steps where there is a gap, the \textit{predicted observations}, $\hat{y}^g_t$, are calculated from the smoothed state $x^s_t$. The smoothing phase works by starting from the last time step and recursively updates $x^s_t$ using $x^s_{t+1}$.

Finally, the distribution of the missing observations, $p(\hat{y}^g_t \mid Y^{ng}, C$, can be computed directly from the smoothed state at each time.

The model always considers the entire probability distribution for the state, which is a Gaussian distribution,  $p(x_t) = \norm{x_t}{m_t}{P_t}$, so stores for each state at each time step the mean ($m_t$) and the covariance are ($P_t$). Similarly, the model predictions are a multivariate Gaussian distribution $p(\hat{y}_t \mid Y^{ng}_{1:t-1}, C) =  \norm{\hat{y_t}}{\mu_{y_t}}{\Sigma_{y_t}}$.

Similarly, the model predictions are a multivariate Gaussian distribution $p(\hat{y}_t) =  \norm{\hat{y_t}}{\mu_{y_t}}{\Sigma_{y_t}}$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Time update}

The first step in a Kalman Filter is computing the probability distribution of the predicted state $x^-_t$, from the state at the previous time step $x_{t-1}$ and the control variable $c_t$. The predicted state distribution is $p(x_{t-1}) = \norm{x_{t-1}}{}{}m_{t-1}, P_{t-1})$. The initial state of the system, before the first observation, has the following distribution $p(x_0) = \norm{x_0}{m_0}{P_0}$.  Using equation \ref{eq:system_state} and the properties of a linear map of Gaussian distributions the following equation can be derived \cite{bishop_pattern_2006, 2020_hennig_pml}:

\begin{align}\label{eq:time_update}
    p(x^-_t \mid Y^{ng}_{1:t-1}) &= \norm{x_t^-}{m_t^-}{ P_t^-}\\
    m_t^- &= Am_{t-1} + B c_t + d \label{eq:time_update_mean}\\
    P_t^- &= AP_{t-1}A^T + Q \label{eq:time_update_cov}
\end{align} 

\paragraph{Measurement update}

The predicted state probability distribution is updated to obtain the distribution of the filtered state, using the current observation $y_t$. Equation \ref{eq:system_obs} describes the distribution of $y_t$ given $x_t$. Using Bayes' theorem, it is possible to compute the distribution of $x_t$ given an observation $y_t$ \cite{bishop_pattern_2006, 2020_hennig_pml}:

\begin{align}
 p(x_t \mid Y^{ng}_{1:t-1}) &= \mathcal{N}(x_t; m_t, P_t) \label{eq:meas_update}\\
 z_t &= Hm_t^- + d \label{eq:meas_update:obs_mean}\\
 S_t &= HP_t^-H^T + R \label{eq:meas_update:obs_cov}\\
 K_t &= P_t^-H^TS_t^{-1} \label{eq:meas_update:kalman_gain}\\
 m_t &= m_t^- + K_t(y_t - z_t) \label{eq:meas_update:state_mean}\\
 P_t &= (I-K_tH)P_t^- \label{eq:meas_update:state_cov}
\end{align}
    
\subparagraph{Missing observations}

The Kalman Filter is able do deal with missing observations and can update the state even in that case. 
If all the observations at time $t$ are missing, the measurement update step is skipped and the filtered ($x_t$) is the same of the predicted state ($x_t^-$). If only some observations in $y_t$ are missing, then a partial measurement step is performed.
The vector containing the observations that are not missing at time $t$, $y^{ng}_t$, can be expressed as a linear transformation of $y_t$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:miss_obs}
    y^{ng}_t = M^{ng}y_t
\end{equation}

where $M^{ng}$ is a mask matrix that is used to select the subset of $y_t$ that is observed. $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{ng} \times n}$ and is made of rows which are made of all zeros but for an entry 1 at the column corresponding to the of the index of the non-missing observation.

For example, if $y_t = [y_{0,t}, y_{1,t}, y_{2,t}]^T$ and $y_{0,t}$ is the missing observation then

\begin{equation}
 M^{ng} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

 using the properties of linear projections of Gaussian distribution it is possible derive the distribution $p(y^{ng}_t \mid y_t)$ and from it $p(y^{ng}_t \mid x_t)$ (appendix Equation \ref{eq:deriv_partial_obs_state})

\begin{align}
   p(y^{ng}_t|y_t) &= \norm{y^{ng}_t}{M\mu_{y_t}}{M\Sigma_{y_t}M^T} \label{eq:partial_obs}\\
  p(y^{ng}_t|x_t) &= \norm{y^{ng}_t}{MHx_t + Mb}{MRM^T}\label{eq:partial_obs_state}
\end{align}

Therefore, it is possible to perform the measurement update step when some observations are missing using a variation of equation \ref{eq:meas_update}, where $H$ is replaced by $MH$, $b$ by $Mb$ and $R$ by $MRM^T$.

\paragraph{Smoothing}

In the smoothing step, the filtered state at time $t$ is updated using the smoothed state ${t+1}$. A set of equations for the smoothing pass of a Kalman Filter has been derived by Rauch-Tung-Striebel \cite{rauch_maximum_1965}. They calculate the smoothed state $x_t^s$ from the smoothed, filtered and predicted state at the successive time step.
For the last time step, the smoothed state is set to be equal to the filtered state.

\begin{align}
    p(x_t^s \mid Y^{ng}) &= \norm{x_t^s}{m_t^s}{P_t^s} \label{eq:smoother}\\
    G_t &= P_tA^T(P_{t+1}^-)^{-1} \label{eq:smoother:gain}\\
    m_t^s &= m_t + G_t(m_{t+1}^s - m_{t+1}^-) \label{eq:smoother:mean}\\
    P_t^s &= P_t + G_t(P_{t+1}^s - P_{t+1}^-)G_t^T \label{eq:smoother:cov}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Predictions}

The distribution of the observed variables in a gap, $\hat{y}^g_t$, can be obtained directly by the distribution of the smoothed state $p(x_t^s | Y^{ng})$.
The missing observed variables a time $t$ are $y^g_t = M^gy_t$, where $M^{g}$ has a similar definition as $M^{ng}$ in equation \ref{eq:miss_obs}, but selects the missing observations instead of  non-missing data.
The following equation can see derived (see appendix equation \ref{eq:deriv_predictions}):

\begin{align}\label{eq:filter_predictions}
    p(\hat{y}^g_t \mid Y^{ng}) &= \norm{\hat{y}^g_t}{\mu_{y_t}}{\Sigma_{y_t}} \\
    \mu_{y_t} &= MHm_t + Mb \\
    \Sigma_{y_t} &= MRM^T + MHP^s_tH^TM^T
\end{align}

The outputs of the KF model are the distribution of $p(y^g_t)$ for all gaps in the observed variables. 

\subsection{Kalman Filter Implementation}

\paragraph{Requirements}

Kalman Filter is a widely used algorithm and there are several python libraries that implement it (e.g. \verb|statsmodels|, \verb|pykalman|, \verb|filterpy|). However, no  Kalman Filter library was identified which meets all the requirements for this work. It is necessary to support gaps, partial measurements updates, control variables and be a numerically stable implementation.
Therefore, a custom library for Kalman Filters was developed using the PyTorch library, which has the advantage of automatic differentiation, possibility to use GPUs and better integration with other Machine Learning methods.

\subsubsection{Numerical stability}

% \paragraph{Background}
The naive implementation of the Kalman filter equations suffers from numerically stability issues \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001, dan_simon_optimal_2006}. %, hence several techniques have been developed to mitigat
Numerical instability arises from the fact that digital computers store numbers only limited precision. This results in a loss of information, so that some operations may be incorrectly performed by a  computer (e.g. summing a big number and a small number).

For Kalman Filter the components that are most affect by numerical instability are the covariance matrices. To analyse the stability of the operations on these matrices it is relevant to consider the condition number for inversion \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001, kaminski_discrete_1971}, which describes if the matrix is going to be singular on the numerical representation in the computer. The condition number $k(A)$ is the ratio between the biggest singular value and the smallest. The singular value is $\sigma^2(A) = \lambda(AA^T)$, with  $\lambda(A)$ being the eigenvalue of $A$.
\begin{equation}\label{condition_number}
    k(A) = \frac{\sigma_{max}(A)}{\sigma_{min}(A)}
\end{equation}

The condition number is 1 for well-conditioned matrices, and tends to infinite for ill-conditioned matrices. As a general rule,  a matrix cannot be inverted when the reciprocal of the condition number for inversion is close to the machine precision $ 1/k(A) < \varepsilon$ \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001}.

\paragraph{Mitigation strategies}

\subparagraph{Machine precision} The simplest to improve the numerical stability is to use higher accuracy in the representation of numbers \cite{dan_simon_optimal_2006}. Practically, this means to use 64bit floats instead of 32bit floats, which is default in PyTorch.

\subparagraph{Matrix decomposition} Another way to improve the numerical stability is to reduce the condition number of the state covariance ($P$). A positive definite matrix has a square root factor, $P^{1/2}$, such as that $P = P^{1/2}(P^{1/2})^T=P^{1/2}P^{\top/2}$.
The Cholesky decomposition is an algorithm to find a square root of a matrix, however the Cholesky decomposition calculates only one of possibly many square roots of the matrix.

Utilizing $P^{1/2}$ instead of $P$ doubles the effective numerical resolution of the filter \cite{kaminski_discrete_1971,dan_simon_optimal_2006,rutten_square-root_2013}. This is due to the fact that the eigenvalues of $P^{1/2}$ are the square root of the eigenvalues of $P$, $\lambda(P) = \lambda^2(P^{1/2})$, thus the conditioning number of $P$ is the square of the conditioning number of $P^{1/2}$. Therefore, if in the filter implementation $P$ is never explicitly computed, the numerical stability of the filter is significantly improved.
There are several implementations of a Kalman Filter that follow this approach \cite{potter_statistical_1963,carlson_fast_1973,bierman_numerical_1977} and are generally called ``square root'' filter.

\subsubsection{Implementation in PyTorch}

There are different approaches to square root filtering. According to \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001} the best approach is the UD Filter (\cite{bierman_numerical_1977}), since it has the smallest computational cost. However, the filter is based on the $UD$ factorization and a custom matrix factorization \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001} and both of those algorithms cannot be efficiently implemented in PyTorch. The PyTorch function \verb|torch.linalg.ldl_factor| performs a $UD$ factorization, but it is an experimental function and is not differentiable. Moreover, the custom matrix factorization would need to be implemented using scalar operations, which are not efficient with PyTorch eager execution.

For this reason, a square root filter that propagates square roots of the covariance matrices is implemented. In this way, all the required computations can be expressed in QR factorization, which is a numerically stable method and is a routine implemented in PyTorch.

\subsubsection{Time update Square Root Filter}

From the equations of the time update step (eq. \ref{eq:time_update}) is possible to derive an algorithm to obtain $P_t^{1/2}$ given $P_{t-1}^{1/2}$, without explicitly computing $P_t$ or $P_{t-1}$. The equations here described are from \textcite[eq. 6.60]{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001}:

Defining:

\begin{equation}
    W = \begin{bmatrix}AP_{t-1}^{1/2} & Q^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

from equation \ref{eq:time_update} the following is true:
\begin{equation}\label{time_update_SR_mult}
WW^T = P_t 
\end{equation}

\begin{multline}
  WW^T =  \begin{bmatrix}AP_{t-1}^{1/2} & Q^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}P_{t-1}^{T/2}A^T \\ Q^{T/2}\end{bmatrix}
  = AP_{t-1}^{1/2}P_{t-1}^{T/2}A^T + Q^{1/2}Q^{T/2} = AP_{t-1}A^T + Q = P_t
\end{multline}

The next step is to factorize  $W=LU$, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is an orthogonal matrix, such as that $UU^T = I$. Then $WW^T = LU(LU)^T = LUU^TL^T = LL^T=P_t$. Hence, $L$ is a square root of $P_t$.

This procedure never explicitly compute $P_t$ and requires only the factorization of a matrix, which is implemented efficiently and in a numerical stable way in the PyTorch \verb|torch.linalg.qr| function. 

\subparagraph{PyTorch implementation} PyTorch does not support natively a $LU$ decompositions, but it implements the QR factorization: $W=QR$, where $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix and $R$ an upper triangular matrix. This can be easily converted into a $LU$ factorization, as by factorizing $W^T$ then $W^T=QR=(QR)^T=R^TQ^T$ and $R^T$ is a lower triangular matrix.

\subparagraph{Summary} The steps of the Square Root time update are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item let  $W = \begin{bmatrix}AP_{t-1}^{1/2} & Q^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}$
    \item do a QR factorization $W^T=TR$
    \item set $P_t^{1/2} = R^T$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Measurement update Square Root Filter}

A similar procedure can be followed for the measurement update step of the filter. The equations here described are from \cite{dan_simon_optimal_2006}.

The starting point is equation \ref{eq:meas_update}, for simplicity the time subscripts are omitted in the following equations.

Defining:

\begin{align}
    M &= \begin{bmatrix} R^{1/2} & H(P^-)^{1/2} \\ 0 & (P^-)^{1/2} \end{bmatrix} \\
    V &= \begin{bmatrix} S^{1/2} & 0 \\ \bar{K} & P^{1/2} \end{bmatrix} \\
    \bar{K} &= KS^{1/2}
\end{align}
    
the following is true:
\begin{equation}\label{update_SR_mult}
    MM^T = VV^T
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    MM^T &= \begin{bmatrix} R^{1/2} & HP^- \\ 0 & (P^-)^{1/2} \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} R^{T/2} & 0 \\ (P^-)^{T/2}H^T & (P^-)^{T/2} \end{bmatrix}= \\
    &=\begin{bmatrix} R^{1/2}R^{T/2} + H(P^-)^{1/2}(P^-)^{T/2}H^T & HP^-)^{1/2}P^-)^{T/2} \\ (P^-)^{T/2}P^-)^{1/2}H^T & (P^-)^{1/2}P^-)^{T/2} \end{bmatrix} = \\
    &=\begin{bmatrix}S & HP^- \\ (P^-)^TH^T & P^- \end{bmatrix} \\
    \\
    VV^T & = \begin{bmatrix} S^{1/2} & 0 \\ \bar{K} & P^{1/2} \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} S^{T/2} & \bar{K}^T \\ 0 & P^{T/2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} S^{1/2}S^{T/2} & S^{1/2}\bar{K}^T \\ \bar{K}S^{T/2} & \bar{K}\bar{K}^T + P^{1/2}P^{T/2} \end{bmatrix}\\
     & = \begin{bmatrix} S & S^{1/2}S^{T/2}K^T \\ KS^{1/2}S^{T/2} & KS^{1/2}S^{T/2}K^T + P\end{bmatrix} \\
     & = \begin{bmatrix} S & HP^- \\ P^-H^T & KHP + P\end{bmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

All blocks of $VV^T$ are directly equal to $MM^T$, but the bottom left one, which is equal due to the measurement update for the covariance (equation \ref{eq:meas_update:state_cov}).

Therefore, by decomposing $M=LU$ then $MM^T=LL^T=VV^T$ and the bottom left block of $U$ of size $k \times k$ of $L$ is a square root of $P$, where $k$ is the number of dimensions of the state $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^k$.

\subparagraph{Summary} The steps of the Square Root measurement update are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item let $M = \begin{bmatrix} R^{1/2} & H(P^-)^{1/2} \\ 0 & (P^-)^{1/2} \end{bmatrix}$
 \item do a QR factorization of $M^T=TU$
 \item $P^{1/2}$ is the bottom left $k \times k$ block of $U$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Predictions Square Root Filter}

The prediction equation for the square root filter are similar to the equations for the time update.

defining:

\begin{equation}
    W = \begin{bmatrix}HP_{t}^{1/2} & R^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

from equation \ref{eq:filter_predictions} the following is true:

\begin{equation}\label{predict_SR_mult}
WW^T = \Sigma_{y_t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{multline}
  WW^T =  \begin{bmatrix}HP_{t}^{1/2} & R^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}P_{t}^{T/2}H^T & R^{T/2}\end{bmatrix}
  = HP_{t}^{1/2}P_{t}^{T/2}H^T + R^{1/2}R^{T/2} = HP_{t}H^T + R = \Sigma_{y_t}
\end{multline}

\subparagraph{Summary} The steps of the Square Root predictions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item let  $W = \begin{bmatrix}HP_t^{1/2} & R^{1/2}\end{bmatrix}$
    \item do a QR factorization of $W^T=TU$
    \item set $\Sigma_{y_t}^{1/2} = U^T$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Smoothing Square Root Filter}

The available literature for implementing square root smoother is scarce compared to square root filter, so no solution has been identified to implement a square root smoother. Therefore, a standard smoother is employed.

Nonetheless, steps were taken to improve the numerical stability of the smoother. The computation in the smoother that is most numerically unstable is the inversion of $P^-_{t+1}$ in equation \ref{eq:smoother:gain} \cite{mohinder_s_grewal_kalman_2001}. The matrix inversion is avoided by using the \verb|torch.cholesky_solve| function. It solves for $X$ the linear system $P^-_{t+1}X=P_tA$, which is equivalent of computing $X = (P_tA^T(P^-_{t+1})^{-1})^T$. This use directly the square root $(P^-_{t+1})^{1/2}$ to avoid the computation of $P^-_{t+1}$. A further step to improve the numerical stability is forcing the covariance matrix to be symmetric, by averaging to upper and lower part at after every time step $P^s_{t, sym} = (P^s_t + (P^s_t)^T)/2$, as suggested in \cite{dan_simon_optimal_2006}.
This approach to numerical stability in the smoother is the same applied by the \texttt{statsmodels} library \cite{noauthor_statsmodelstsastatespacekalman_filterkalmanfilter_nodate}.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

\label{table:parameters}

    Initial state covariance & $P_0$ & $k \times k$ & diag(3) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Kalman Filter is implemented as PyTorch module, whose parameters are described in Table \ref{table:parameters}.
There is no change over time of the parameters, and the state of the filter is initialized always at the same value from the parameters $m_0$ and $P_0$.

\paragraph{Constraint}

An important aspect for implementing a Kalman Filter in PyTorch is constraining the parameters that represents covariance ($Q$, $R$ and $P_0$) to be positive definite. To achieve this goal the optimizer works on a raw parameter, which is then transformed into a positive definite matrix.
The transformation into a positive definite matrix is done by transforming the raw parameter into a lower triangular matrix with a positive diagonal. The diagonal is enforced to be positive by transforming the diagonal of the raw parameter with the softplus function ($x = \log (1 + e^{x})$), which is a positive function.
 In addition, a small positive offset $\num{1e-5}$ is added to the diagonal in order to avoid that the diagonal is close to zero, which may result in a positive semi-definite matrix.

The inverse of the positive definite transformation is implemented, so that parameters can be manually set.

This implementation of the positive definite constraint makes it is that is straightforward to obtain the Cholesky factor of the parameters, which are needed by the Square Root Filter, and at the same time the full parameters, which are needed by the smoother.

\subsubsection{Parameters initialization}

The model parameters could be initialized using random values, however this would increase numerical stability issues and increase the training time. Moreover, if the initial parameters are very distant from the optimal ones, it is more likely for the optimization algorithm to find only a local minimum.  The simplicity of the Kalman Filter and the interpretability of its parameters allows to manually initialize the parameters with realist values.

\paragraph{State transition matrix} $A$ is initialized using a ``local linear trend'' model \cite{durbin_time_2012-1}. The idea is that half of the state $x_{l_{t-1}}$ represent the level of the current state and the second half the slope $x_{s_{t-1}}$ of a linear function that describes the rate of change of the state between time steps. The next state level is equal to the current level plus the slope and a random noise, while the slope remains constant but for another random noise. The use of a slope allows the model to retain information of several previous states.

\paragraph{Observation Matrix} $H$ is initialized with an identity matrix. This means that each observed variable is modelled by one variable in the state. The second part of $H$ is 0 as in a local trend model the observations do not depend on the slope but only the level of the state.

\paragraph{Control matrix} $B$ is initialized to the difference between the previous observation and the current observation. The number of  variables in the control may be different than the observed variables. In this initialization, the assumption is that $n_{ctr} < n$ and that there is a correspondence between the control and first $n_{ctr}$ variables of the observations and hence of the state.

\paragraph{Covariances} The state transition covariance $Q$ and then observation covariance $R$ are initialized as diagonal matrix with values of $0.1$ and $0.01$ respectively. This number has been chosen to represent an uncertainty in the state transition that is compatible with the standard deviation of the variables (1 as they are standardized) and a low uncertainty in the observations. 

\paragraph{Offsets} The observation and state transition offsets are initialized to zero.

\paragraph{Initial state} The initial state is set to have as mean zero and as covariance diag(3). The number 3 is an arbitrary number bigger than the state transition covariance, which should represent the high level of uncertainty for the initial state.  

\subsubsection{Loss Function}

The loss function is used to train the model is the negative log likelihood, computed for each data point. At each time step, the model predicts a multivariate normal distribution $p(\hat{y}^g_t \mid Y)$, which is used to compute the negative log likelihood given the actual observations $y_t^g$. The negative log likelihoods between different time steps in the same gap are summed. Then negative log likelihood is averaged between batches.

The actual loss function of the model should be the log likelihood of the joint distribution $p(Y^g)$. However, the analytical form of the joint distribution cannot to easily derived from the Kalman Filter equations. The log likelihood of marginal distributions is instead used, as it is a lower bound to the log likelihood of the joint distribution. Defining $q(x)$ the predicted joint distribution, $p(x)$ the real joint distribution and $q_i(x)$ the marginal distribution at the \textit{i}th time step:
\begin{equation}
    q_i(x) = \int q(x_1, ..., x_k)dx_{\neg i}
\end{equation}

Then, if the family of distribution of $q(x \mid \theta)$,  is the same of $\prod_i q_i(x \mid \theta)$, where $\theta$ are the model parameters. Then

\begin{equation}\label{eq:log_joint_geq}
    \max_\theta \E{\log q(x\mid \theta)}_{x \sim p(x)} \geq \max_\theta \E{\log \prod_i q_i(x\mid \theta)}_{x \sim p(x)}
\end{equation}

because $\prod_i q_i(x)$ is more restricted. This means that $q(x)$ fit at least as good as $\prod_i q_i(x)$.
For the Kalman Filter $q_i(x)$ is a Gaussian distribution, so $\prod_i q_i(x)$ is also a Gaussian distribution and equation \ref{eq:log_joint_geq} holds.

\subsubsection{Metrics}

The main metric used to assess the model performance is the \emph{Root Mean Square Error} (RMSE). 

\begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^n (y^g_i - \hat{y}^g_i)^2}{n}}
\end{equation}

The advantage of the RMSE is that it can be used also for non-probabilistic methods (e.g. MDS) and that its value has the same physical dimension as the observed variable. The main drawback is that is cannot be used for comparison between variables. For that, the \emph{Standardized} RMSE is used, which is the RMSE computed on the standardized variables. The 

\begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\sigma_Y} 
\end{equation}

Other metrics, like the $R^2$ score and the mean absolute percentage error were evaluated, however none of them are suitable for this application. The $R^2$ is defined as $R^2 = 1 - (\sum_{i}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2)/(\sum_{i}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2)$, if the denominator is close to zero, then value of $R^2$ tends to $- \infty$. Since the gaps are often short and several variables are constant over short periods (e.g. \vv{SW\_IN}, \vv{SWC}) the denominator of the $R^2$ would be close to zero and the metrics cannot be effectively used. The mean absolute percentage error is defined as $\text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n_-1} (\left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|)/(\left| y_i \right|)$, which tends to $\infty$ when $y_i$ tends to 0, as zero is a possible value of several variables (e.g. \vv{SW\_IN}, \vv{TA}) this metric cannot be employed.
It would be possible to use $R^2$ or MAPE, for a subset of variables and gap lengths, but this limits the ability to perform comparison across different settings. 

\subsubsection{Performance considerations} 

The iterative nature of the filter, where the current state depends on the previous state, makes it impossible to use PyTorch vectorization across different time steps. This can significantly limit the performance of the filter, especially when executed on GPUs. In order to  mitigate this issue, all functions in the Kalman Filter library support batches, so at every time step different data is processed in parallel.


\subsection{Data}

\subsubsection{Data source}

The data used to evaluate the performance of Kalman Filters is from the Hainich (Germany) site. The EC site in Hainich (DE-Hai) is on a deciduous beech forest and it managed by the bioclimatology department at the  University of Göttingen. The source of the data is  the FLUXNET 2015 Dataset \cite{pastorello_fluxnet2015_2020}, which for Hainich includes measurements with a 30 mins frequency between 2000 and 2012. In total 227952 observations are available. For simplicity, the entire dataset was used for the model training, which includes also gap-filled observations.

All the meteorological variables that are gap-filled in the FLUXNET 2015 dataset were selected for the analysis (Table \ref{table:variables}).

\paragraph{ERA-Interim} The FLUXNET 2015 dataset also includes the ERA-I dataset for each site. The data is bias corrected and temporally downscaled.
The ERA-I data is used as the control variable for the Kalman Filter. All the variables of interest are present in ERA-I, except for TS and SWC.

\end{table}



\paragraph{Data preparation pipeline}

The dataset needs to be pre-processed by dividing into data blocks, adding an artificial gap and then standardize. The data preparation pipeline takes as input a list of items and outputs the data in a format suitable for training. Each item provides all the information about a gap with the following fields a) \verb|i| the index of the block b) \verb|shift|  the offset of the data block c) \verb|var_sel| the variables in the gap d) \verb|gap_len| the gap length. The pipeline perform the following steps: 1) split the index of complete data frame from Hainich into blocks of a given length and selects the \textit{i}th element  2) adds the shift to move the starting point of the data block and select the data from the data frame. For the control variable it also adds the observations with a lag 1, so that at the time $t$ the model has access to the control variable both at time $t$ and $t-1$ 3) creates one continuous artificial gap in the middle of the block for the variables specified in \verb|var_sel| and with a length of \verb|gap_len| 4) convert from Pandas data frame to a PyTorch Tensor 5) Standardize each variable, using the mean ($\mu_Y$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_Y$) of the whole dataset.

\begin{equation}\label{standardized}
    y^z_t = \frac{(y_t - \mu_Y)}{\sigma_Y}
\end{equation}

After this, the tensors are collated into a batch and potentially moved to the GPU.

\paragraph{Prediction pipeline}

The model predicts the mean and the covariance for each time steps for the standardized variables. This needs to be converted back to be scale of the variable to be used for imputation. This operation needs to scale the whole distributions and not only the mean of the prediction. The standardized prediction $\hat{y}^z_t$ is distributed $p(\hat{y}^z_t) = \norm{\hat{y_t}^z}{\mu^z_{\hat{y_t}}}{\Sigma^z_{\hat{y_t}}}$, the prediction in the original scale $\hat{y}_t$ is distributed $p(\hat{y}_t) =  \norm{\hat{y_t}}{\mu_{\hat{y_t}}}{\Sigma_{\hat{y_t}}}$ and $\Sigma_Y = \text{diag}(\sigma_Y)$. 

Then from the inverse of equation \ref{standardized}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{y}_t = \Sigma_Y\hat{y}^z_t + \mu_Y
\end{equation}

Then using the properties of the linear projections of Gaussian distributions

\begin{equation}
    p(\hat{y}_t) = \norm{\hat{y}_t}{\Sigma_Y\mu^z_{\hat{y_t}} + \mu_Y}{\Sigma_Y\Sigma^z_{\hat{y_t}}\Sigma_Y^T}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model Training}

The available data is split between training and validation set, the first 80\% of the data points used for training, the remaining 20\% for validation. The split is not random, so the validation set does not contain periods of time close to the one used for training.

The filter is initialized with 9 dimensions for the observations (one for each variable). For the state 18 dimensions, the first 9 dimensions are to match the number of observed variables and the other 9 are for the slope in the local trend model. The control has 14 dimensions, with 7 for the control at time $t$ and the other 7 for the control at time $t-1$.

The model is trained using gradient descend, by minimizing the loss function. It employs the ADAM optimizer \cite{kingma_adam_2017}.

Several versions of the Kalman Filter are trained using data with different patterns in the gaps. Figure \ref{fig:training} shows the different combinations. Each model version has a name that reflects the training conditions, that follows this pattern: \textit{KF-\textlangle var missing\textrangle-\textlangle n var missing\textrangle-\textlangle range gap lengths\textrangle[-\textlangle modifier\textrangle]}.

\paragraph{Generic model} The first model to be trained is a generic model (\textbf{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}), where each data block has a gap in one variable with the length of sampled from a uniform distribution between \num{6} (3 hours) and \num{336} (1 week). For each gap, only one variable is missing, which is sampled with equal probability from the list of all variables. The shift is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 50. For each block of data in the original data frame, 10 different artificial gaps were created, resulting in a total of 4080 data blocks used for training and 520 for validation. 
The length of the block of data is \num{446}, so that at least \num{50} observations are available to the model before and after the gap. The batch size is \num{20}.
The model was trained for \num{3} epochs with a learning rate of \num{1e-3}.

\paragraph{Variable fine-tuning} The generic model has been fine tune for each variable (\textbf{KF-\textlangle var \textrangle-Sin-6\_336}), resulting in 9 different models. The training settings are the same for the generic model, expect that the gaps is only in one variable and then number of repetitions for each is 5 (training 2040 blocks validation 260 blocks). Each variable, was fine tuned with a different combination of epochs and learning rates (lr): \vv{TA} 3 epochs with lr \num{1e-3} and 1 epoch with lr \num{1e-5}, \vv{SW\_IN} \num{7} epochs with lr \num{1e-3}, LW\_ N\num{3} epochs with lr \num{1e-3}, VPD \num{6} epochs with lr \num{1e-3}, WS \num{3} epochs with lr \num{1e-3}, PA \num{3} epochs with lr \num{1e-3} and 1 epoch with lr \num{1e-5}, P no additional training, TS \num{6} epochs, SWC \num{8} epochs with lr \num{1e-3} and 1 epoch with lr \num{1e-5}. The learning was manually stopped when the training loss started being constant or the validation loss started to increase.

\paragraph{Short gaps} The numerical stability issue limits the gap length to 30 observations (15 hours) if all variables are missing. Therefore, an additional set of models has been trained with gaps in multiple variables.  

\subparagraph{Gap for all variables} A version of the model was trained only with gaps in all variables (\textbf{KF-Gen-All-6\_30}). The length of the gap ranges from 6 to 30 (3 to 15 hours). The training set contains, 7000 unique data blocks and 1760 for validation. The training started from the generic model lasted for 3 epochs with a learning rate of \num{3e-4}.

\subparagraph{Single gap} The generic model has been fine tune short gaps (\textbf{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_30}). The was training for 3 epochs with a learning rate of \num{3e-4}.

\subparagraph{Gap multiple variables} Another version of the model has been trained with gaps in any number of variable (\textbf{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_30}). The number of variables missing has been drawn from a uniform distribution  from 1 to $n$, and the variables missing sampled with equal probability. The total gap length ranges from 6 to 30 (3 to 15 hours). For each original data block, 20 different artificial gaps were generated for a total of 28000 blocks in the training set and 7020 in validation. The model was trained starting from \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336} for 3 epochs with a learning rate of \num{5e-5} and then 1 epoch with a learning rate of \num{1e-5}.

\paragraph{Additional version} Two more model have been trained, where the difference is in the model characteristics instead of the data.

\subparagraph{Random parameters} A model has been initialized with random parameters, drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 (\textbf{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_30-Rand}). The data used for training is the same of  \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_30}. [training is still running]

\subparagraph{No Control} The last version of the model is one where the use of the control variables was disabled (\textbf{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336-No\_Contr}). The data is the same of \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336} and the training was from scratch for \num{3} epochs with a learning rate of \num{1e-3}.

\subsection{Other methods}

\subsubsection{MDS}

The implementation of the MDS used in the results comparison is from REddyProc (\cite{wutzler_basic_2018}). This package has been used because it provides an R interface, that can be easily integrated with Python. Conversely, ONEFlux implements only a C interface, whose integration in Python is significantly more challenging.  The MDS algorithm in REddyProc and ONEFlux are fully equivalent. In detail, the function \verb|REddyProc::sEddyProc_sMDSGapFill| was used, with the defaults setting of using SW\textunderscore IN, TA an VPD are driver with a tolerance of 2.5 \si{^\circ C}, 50 \si{W/m^s} and 5 \si{hPa} respectively as described in \cite{reichstein_separation_2005-3}.
The data provided to MDS has a context of at least 90 days around the gap, as required by REddyProc. 

\subsubsection{ERA} The imputation using ERA-Interim was performed by using the ERA variables available in the FLUXNET dataset without further correction.

Abbreviations: Air Temperature \texttt{TA}, Incoming Shortwave Radiation \texttt{SW\_IN}, Incoming Longwave Radiation \texttt{LW\_IN}, Vapour Pressure Deficit \texttt{VPD}, Wind Speed \texttt{WS}, Air Pressure \texttt{PA}, Precipitation \texttt{P}, Soil Temperature \texttt{TS}, Soil Water Content \texttt{SWC}}
    % \label{fig:correlation}


The analysis of the pattern in the variable temporal autocorrelation and inter-variable correlations supports the interpretation of the results of the imputation methods, as it highlight which mechanisms are available to the model to impute each variable

\paragraph{} The temporal autocorrelation, for a lag up to 48 hours is shown in figure \ref{fig:correlation}. Overall the meteorological variables have a high temporal autocorrelation, that decreases with the gap length. The only exception is the precipitation (\vv{P}). Moreover several variables (i.e. Air Temperature \texttt{TA}, Incoming Shortwave Radiation \texttt{SW\_IN},  Vapour Pressure Deficit \texttt{VPD}, Soil Temperature \texttt{TS}, Soil Water Content \texttt{SWC}) have a daily pattern with the temporal autocorrelation with a lag of 24 or 48 hours being higher than the one at shorter lags (eg. 12 hours). This is particularly evident in \vv{SW\_IN}, that has a negative correlation for a lag of 12 hours.

\paragraph{} The variable with the highest correlation with other variable is \vv{TA}, which is correlated with 5 other variables (correlation coefficient bigger 0.4). \vv{TS} is highly correlated with the air temperature, thus following a similar pattern. Four variables: \texttt{SW\_IN} \texttt{LW\_IN}, \texttt{VPD}, \vv{SWC} have a correlation ranging between 0.4 and 0.6 with at least two other variables, while the remaining three variables: wind speed (\vv{WS}), air pressure (\vv{PA}) and precipitation (\vv{P}) have a low correlation with any other variable.  


\subsection{Comparison to other imputation methods}

The Kalman Filter (KF) has an overall better imputation performance than the other imputation methods: ERA-I and MDS. In all tested scenario, except for precipitation, it exhibits the same pattern: KF is the method with the smallest imputation error, ERA-I is the second-best method while MDS is the worst performing approach (Figure \ref{fig:the_plot} and Table \ref{the_table}). For precipitation, the three methods are equivalent.

\paragraph{} I compared the models by creating artificial gaps in a single variable with four different gap lengths (i.e. 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 1 week). For each combination of variable and gap length, 500 artificial gaps were generated and imputed using the 3 methods. The performance was measured using the RMSE (Figure \ref{fig:the_plot} and Table \ref{the_table}) and the standardized RMSE (appendix Figure \ref{fig:the_plot_stand} and Table \ref{the_table_stand}). In addition, the imputation performance is compared visually using three different example time series for all the combinations of each variable and three gap lengths: 6 hours, 12 hours and 1 week (Figures \ref{fig:ts_1-1}, \ref{fig:ts_1-2} and appendix Figures \ref{fig:ts_2-1} \ref{fig:ts_2-2}, \ref{fig:ts_3-1}, \ref{fig:ts_3-2}). For each variable, the fine-tuned KF model has been used (\textit{KF-\textlangle var\textrangle-Sin-6\_336}).

\paragraph{}
The average error reduction across all variable and gap lengths is 33\% compared to ERA-I and 57\% compared to MDS, if precipitation (\vv{P}) is excluded. The improvement of the KF compared to the best ERA-I (best performing state-of-the-art model) strongly depends on the variable analysed and the gap length, ranging from 54\% for air temperature (\vv{TA}) to 5\% for incoming longwave radiation (\vv{LW\_IN}).

Furthermore, by analysing multiple artificial gaps for the same conditions (i.e. missing variable and gap length) the maximum value and the standard deviation of the gaps' RMSE is computed. For virtually every scenario, the KF is the method with the smallest maximum and standard deviation of the RMSE (Figure \ref{fig:the_plot} and Table \ref{the_table}). 

The imputation performance between different variable can be compared by analysing the standardized RMSE, which measure the imputation error relative to the variable standard deviation. There is a wide range of imputation performance, with the standardized RMSE of the worst variable being 10 times the one of the best variable.
The variables with the best imputation quality are:
Air Pressure (\vv{PA}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.06$),
Air Temperature (\vv{TA}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.08$)
and Soil Water Content (\vv{SWC}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.09$).
Soil Temperature (\vv{TS} , $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.14$),
Vapour Pressure Deficit (\vv{VPD}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.17$),
Incoming Shortwave Radiation (\vv{SW\_IN}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.25$)
Incoming Longwave Radiation (\vv{LW\_IN}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.33$)
have an intermediate imputation quality.
While the variable with the highest imputation error are: Wind Speed (\vv{WS}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.47$) and  Precipitation (\vv{P}, $\text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} = 0.67$).

\include{tables2/the_table}

The performance of the KF for each variable is analysed in detail and compared with the other methods.

\paragraph{Air Temperature} Air temperature is the variable where there is the with the biggest improvement in performance when using KF. KF outperforms ERA-I for all gap lengths, with an average reduction in the RMSE of 54\% and of 77\% compared to MDS. Comparing KF with ERA-I, the relative improvement in RMSE decrease with the gap length (69 \% for 6 hours gaps, 41\% for 1 week long gaps), while the average difference in RMSE increases with the gap length (0.29 °C  for 6 hours gaps, 0.34 °C for 1 week long gaps).
The visual inspection of the time series indicate an overall very good reconstruction of the missing data by the KF. 

\paragraph{Incoming shortwave Radiation} The KF is the method with the smaller average RMSE, but the relative improvement is small, only 12\% compared to ERA-I. The highest error is at night, where \vv{SW\_IN} is by definition always 0, but the KF often predicts sudden changes and negative values with errors in the order of 50 \si{W/m^2}. However, during the day, which is the most important condition in \vv{SW\_IN} imputation, the KF is better than other methods. This is also confirmed by visual inspections of the time series.
% The main factor behind the changes in \vv{SW\_IN} is the cloud cover, which ERA-I often correctly predicts and consequently the KF can access this information, while the MDS is unable to model this type of changes.

\paragraph{Incoming Longwave Radiation} The imputation performance of the KF is comparable with the one of ERA-I. However, KF is the best method for short gaps (20 \% improvement for 6 hours long gaps). This can be visualized in the 12 hours gap in figure \ref{fig:ts_3-1}. The imputation performance of MDS is poor, especially for long gaps.

\paragraph{Vapour Pressure Deficit} KF is the best model for all gap lengths, the relative performance is higher for short gaps (66 \% compared to ERA-I for 6 hours gaps) and progressively smaller for longer gaps (32 \% compared to ERA-I for 1 week long gaps). The analysis of the time series suggest that the KF is overall good at reconstructing the higher frequency changes of \vv{VPD}, but in some scenarios KF incorrectly predicts short term variation (e.g. 1 week long gap in figure \ref{fig:ts_2-1}).

\paragraph{Wind Speed} The KF is the best method imputation method for all gap lengths, with an average error reduction of 21\% compared to ERA-I. The wind speed is the variable with the second highest standardized RMSE (appendix figure \ref{fig:the_plot_stand}), which indicates that the RMSE is high compared to the \vv{WS} standard deviation (0.47 for KF). The visual inspection of the time series (figure \ref{fig:ts_2-1} and \ref{fig:ts_3-1}), indicates that the \vv{WS} has a high variability on a short time scales, which is not captured neither by ERA-I nor by the KF.

\paragraph{Air Pressure} The imputation error of \vv{PA} is low for KF and ERA-I. The KF outperforms ERA-I with an improvement ranging from 36\% for 6 hours gaps to 20\% for 1 week long gaps. The visual analysis of the time series suggest that the KF slightly overestimate the short term variability for \vv{PA}. MDS is significantly worse, with the imputation error an order of magnitude bigger than ERA-I.

\paragraph{Precipitation} The Precipitation is a variable where no methods perform well, with models in some case predicting precipitation event that do not exist and in other missing the real precipitation. The RMSE of the three methods is comparable. However, the RMSE is not an accurate metric for \vv{P} imputation, due to the very high number of data points with no precipitation (over 90\% in Hainich). For reference, the RMSE of a null model (i.e. always predicts 0) is 0.28 \si{mm}, which is comparable with the errors of all imputation methods. 
The visual analysis of the time series shows that ERA-I predictions are the one that are physically realistic, even though the precipitation amount is often incorrect, while the KF often predicts negative values for \vv{P}, which is physically impossible and MDS in a tested scenario (Appendix figure \ref{fig:ts_2-2}) predicts an unlikely constant low amount of \vv{P} for a long period.

\paragraph{Soil Water Content} The KF is the best imputation method, for short gaps there is an error reduction of 61\% compared to MDS, while for long gap (1 week) the absolute error of the KF roughly doubles and the improvement is performance is limited to 23\%. \vv{SWC} is a variable that is not available in ERA-I, so KF and MDS are the only available methods and does not have access to a control variable for \vv{SWC}.
The analysis of the time series shows that the mean of KF prediction is overall accurate, and notably manages also to predict sudden changes in \vv{SWC} (figure \ref{fig:ts_1-2}). However, the KF constantly predict small variations in the soil water content, which are not reflected in the observations.

\paragraph{Soil Temperature} The KF is the best imputation method for short gaps (less than 24 hours), but the MDS is better for 1 week long gaps (Figure \ref{fig:the_plot}). For short gaps there is a big difference in the methods' error (up to 60\%), but is reduced for long gaps (KF is 15\% worse than MDS).
\vv{TS} is not available in the ERA-I dataset.
In two of the long time series analysed the \vv{TS} is almost constant (figure \ref{fig:ts_1-2} and \ref{fig:ts_3-2}), but the KF incorrectly predicts important variations, while the MDS is overall constant. In another scenario (appendix figure \ref{fig:ts_2-2}), where there is a diurnal pattern in \vv{TS}, the KF predictions have an overall correction shape, even though there is roughly 1 °C error.

\subsection{Aspects affect Kalman Filter performance}

\subsubsection{Gap Length}

The effect of the gap length on the KF imputation performance was analyzed by measuring the RMSE on gaps in a single variable for lengths ranging from 1 hour to 1 week (Figure \ref{fig:gap_len} and appendix Table \ref{gap_len}). For the majority of the variables the error increases with the gap length only up to 24 hours and then is almost constant. For three variables (\vv{P}, \vv{SWC} and \vv{TS}) the imputation error keep increasing after 24 hours, but the rate decreases with the gap length. For all variables, the highest rate of change of the imputation error is between 1 hour long gaps and 12 hours long gaps.

For all variables, there is a significant difference in the error of very short gaps (1 hour) and long gaps (1 week) in all variables, on average the error for gaps 1 hour long is the 31\% of the one for 1 week long gaps.
The variability in the RMSE between gaps (i.e. std in appendix table \ref{gap_len}) is roughly constant between the different gap lengths.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item short gaps have a smaller error
%     \item then there is a steep increase for gaps up to 24 hours
%     \item after 24 hours the is no or little change into the error
%     \item the variability on of the error between gaps (std of RMSE) follows a similar partner
%     \item \vv{P} and \vv{SWC} and \vv{TS} are an exception from this pattern, with both the mean and std oft the error increasing for gaps longer than a day
% \end{itemize}



% \textbf{goal} impact of the gap length on the gap filling
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth]{gap_len}}
\caption{Effect of gap length on the KF performance. The solid line shows the median RMSE, while the shaded area is delimited by the first and third quartile. The dotted black line is the mean ERA-I error for the entire dataset (ERA-I data is not available for \vv{SWC} and \vv{TS}). Seven different gaps lengths were tested (1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week), for each of them 500 artificial gaps were generated for every variable (total 31500 gaps). For each variable, the fine-tuned KF model has been used (\textit{KF-\textlangle var\textrangle-Sin-6\_336}.}
\label{fig:gap_len}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Control variables}

The importance of the control variables has been assessed by comparing the imputation error of a KF model that uses the control variables (\textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}) with a KF model that does not have access to the control variables (\textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336-No\_Contr}). Both models are not fine-tuned for each variable.

In general, the control variables improve the imputation performance for all variables for all gap lengths. The exceptions are \vv{P} and \vv{TS}, where the use of the two models are equivalent, and for short gaps (6 hours) in \vv{SWC} and \vv{WS}, where the model with the control performs worse than the one without control (Figure \ref{fig:control}).
For all variables, the longer the gap, the biggest the performance improvement of the model with the control variables (appendix Table \ref{control}). Notably, the use of the control variables improve the prediction performance for \vv{SWC}, even though is a variable that is not present in ERA-I.
The variable that benefits the most from the control is \vv{PA}, where for gaps 1 week long, the model without the control has an error almost 6 times bigger than the one with the control.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item generic model with control vs generic model without control
%     \item for short gaps the use of the control is increasing the error
%     \item for longer gaps the control is usually helping
%     \item for \vv{SWC} and \vv{TA} using the control is slightly worse
%     \item for \vv{PA} the error without control is much higher around 5 times bigger for 1 week long gaps.
%     \item for \vv{P} control is helping a bit
% \end{itemize}

% \textbf{goal} show how the use of the control (ERA-5 data) in the gap is impacting the predictions

\label{fig:control}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gaps in multiple variables}

The importance of the inter-variable correlation for the KF predictions has been assessed by comparing the imputation for a gap with only one variable missing and then same gap with all variables missing. All the gaps were imputed using the same model, \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_30}. The gap length is limited to 15 hours due to numerical stability issues.

The presence of other variables in the gap is overall improving the model predictions, for some variables there is a significant error reduction (e.g. around 40 \% for \vv{TA}) but for others the improvement is minimal (e.g. less than 2\% for \vv{WS}).

Across the different variables, there is an increase in the absolute values of the difference in RMSE with an increase in gap length.
% \begin{itemize}
%     % \item the max gap length is 15 because after that the model crashed due to numerical stability issues
%     \item compare a specialized model with gap in only one var and a generic model trained with gaps in all variables
%     \item Overall for short gaps variable correlation doesn't help much and actually is worse
%     \item for \vv{TA} presence other variables helps to reduce error and variability of error
%     \item for \vv{SW\_IN} worse with other variables for gap of 15 hours
%     \item for \vv{VPD} and \vv{WS} other variable help reducing both mean and std for RMSE 
%     \item for \vv{P} other variables increase error
%     \item \vv{SWC} the RMSE is higher when there are other variables in the gap
%     \item for \vv{TS} when there are other var err higher for short gaps but then comparable
% \end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Kalman Filter training}

\subsubsection{Variable fine-tuning}

The performance of the KF is improved if the model is fine-tuned with gaps only for one variable (e.g. only for \vv{TA}). For each variable a different model has been used (\textit{KF-\textlangle var \textrangle-Sin-6\_336}) and the performance compared to a generic model that has been trained with one gap in any variable (\textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}). For each combination of gap length and variable, 500 artificial gaps were created.

The fine-tuning is reducing the error for all the variables (Figure \ref{fig:generic} and appendix Table \ref{generic}). The entity of the error reduction changes depending on the variable, ranging from 75\% for \vv{SWC} to 12\% for \vv{LW\_IN}.
The precipitation is not only variable that is not fine-tuned, as during the training no consistent improvement in performance was found.
For the majority of variables, the variability of the RMSE between gaps of the fine-tuned model and the maximum RMSE is also smaller for the fine-tuned model.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item fine-tuning the model is improving the performance across all variables
%     \item biggest increase is in \vv{SWC} and \vv{TA}, which much smaller error especially for long gap. Variability of RMSE also decreases
% \end{itemize}

For each combination of variable and gap length, 500 artificial gaps were created.}
\label{fig:generic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Training limitations}

During the training of different KF versions I experienced limitation in the ability of the KF to learn the optimal parameters. For instance, if the KF is initialized with random parameters it will never achieve the same performance of a KF initialized with the local trend model. The training conditions are the same, so the model that starts with random parameters should be able to learn the same parameters, but this is often not the case.

The difficulties to train the KF model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:train_compare}.
Three models are compared: a model trained with gaps in multiple variables (\textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336}), a mode trained with gaps of only one variable (\textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}) and one model trained with gaps in multiple variables but initialized with random parameters (\textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336-Rand}).
All models are trained until there is no improvement in the validation loss. The three models are used to impute a gap where only one variable is missing.
The expectation is that they should have comparable performance, but this is not the case (Figure \ref{fig:train_compare} and appendix Table \ref{train_compare}). The training conditions between \textit{KF-Gen-Mulit-6\_336} and \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336-Rand} are exactly the same, so they should be able to achieve the same performance. The other model, \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}, is trained on the same conditions thxat are used for testing, so it should not perform worse than \textit{KF-Multi-Sin-6\_336}.

The best model is always \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}, while depending on variables, the second-best model is either \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336} or \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336-Rand}.

\subsubsection{Numerical Stability} The numerical instability of the current KF implementation limits the gap length to 15 hours long, if all the observations are missing. When only one variable is missing in a gap, the gap length can be at least 2 weeks long.

The numerical instability produces covariance matrices that are not positive definite, which in turns makes the log likelihood computation to fail. The numerical stability of the filter is influenced by the values of the parameters, the observed data, the length of the gap and the total number of observations.

The Square Root KF effectively mitigates the numerical stability (appendix Figure \ref{fig:num_stab}, but results in a small decrease in the runtime performance, with the execution time increasing by 2\% in the tested scenario (appendix Figure \ref{fig:num_stab_perf}).

\caption{Visualization of KF training difficulties. For a gap in one variable, three models are compared: a model trained with gaps in multiple variables (in green \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336}), a model trained with gaps of only one variable (in purple \textit{KF-Gen-Sin-6\_336}) and one model trained with gaps in multiple variables but initialized with random parameters (in orange \textit{KF-Gen-Multi-6\_336-Rand}). The models are expected to have the same performance. For each combination of variable and gap length, 500 artificial gaps were created.}

\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Kalman Filter performance}

The Kalman Filter model outperforms the imputation of current methods is almost every scenario tested. This result confirm the starting hypothesis that the imputation of EC meteorological time series could be improved by making a more effective use of temporal autocorrelation and combining the imputation approaches.

\paragraph{} The structure of the Kalman Filter, which models the evolution of the state between consecutive time steps, makes the temporal autocorrelation key for obtaining accurate predictions. The results are consistent with this: the relative performance of the KF is higher for short gaps and the imputation error of the KF has a strong dependence on the gap length only for gaps shorter than 24 hours.  The shorter the gap, the higher the correlation between the observations close to the gap and the missing data and therefore the possibility of an accurate imputation. Moreover, the relative performance of the KF is higher for variables that have a higher temporal correlation (\vv{TA}, \vv{PA} and \vv{VPD}).



% The results confirm the hypothesis that temporal autocorrelation is a key approach for imputing gaps in meteorological variables. One of the biggest strength of the KF is that it make better use of temporal autocorrelation, which is the likely the biggest single factor behind the improved performance of the KF. The fact that the error is increasing with the gap length only for the first 24 hours is confirming this. Moreover, the variables the relative performance of the filter is higher for variables that have a higher temporal correlation (\vv{TA}, \vv{PA} and \vv{VPD})

\paragraph{} The improvement of KF performance across all variables when including the control variables confirms the hypothesis that the combination of the imputation approaches can produce better predictions. In line with the expectations, the use of the ERA-I data is more important for the KF performance for long gaps, but has limited importance for short gaps. Notably, the use of the control improve the predictions also for \vv{SWC}, even if it is not present in the ERA-I dataset.


\paragraph{} The KF model is able to exploit inter-variable correlation to improve the predictions. Overall, the imputation of variables with the highest correlation benefit the most from the presence of the other variables in the gaps, which matches the expectation. This relationship is, however, not true for every variable. For instance, \vv{TS} has a high correlation with other variables, but I observed only a relatively small difference in performance between gaps with all other variables available and gaps with all other variables missing.
Further, this analysis was limited to short gaps, but it is reasonable to expect that for longer gaps inter-variable correlation plays a bigger role in the KF predictions.


\paragraph{Variables details}

\subparagraph{Shortwave radiation} The low performance of the \vv{SW\_IN} at night highlights a limitation of the Kalman filter.  At its core, the KF considers only the evolution of the state between consecutive time steps, hence it cannot directly model the daily pattern of \vv{SW\_IN}. The only way the KF can predict this daily changes is either by using other variables or the control variables. The former is not possible for \vv{SW\_IN} as it is the only variable with a very pronounced daily pattern, the latter is the main way the KF can maintain a good imputation performance for longer gaps (see Figure \ref{fig:control}).

The limited performance of the \vv{SW\_IN} at night can also be explained by the big difference in the rate of change of \vv{SW\_IN} between the day and the night, as the KF uses constant parameters cannot include accurately model is variability in conditions.

\subparagraph{Precipitation} The precipitation has a low temporal autocorrelation and low correlation with other variables. Moreover, it has a high temporal and spatial variability \cite{mital_sequential_2020} especially on short time scales. In fact, ERA-I predictions have a high error for \vv{P}, which is further worsened by the temporal downscaling. The authors of the paper that introduced ERA-I for EC meteorological imputation \cite{vuichard_filling_2015}, considered the timing of the precipitation in ERA-I not accurate enough for a direct comparison of the time series.
Therefore, the poor performance of the KF is expected as none of the mechanisms used for imputations (i.e. temporal autocorrelation, inter-variable correlation and control variables) can be effectively applied to gaps in \vv{P}. Furthermore, the peculiar distribution of \vv{P}, where zero is by far the most common value, further limits the potential of using a KF.

Precipitation has unique characteristic compared to the other meteorological variables, which make is necessary to employ tailored imputation approaches. For instance, the method developed in \cite{chivers_imputation_2020} the prediction is divided in two steps, a first model predicts whether there is going to be precipitation and a second model predicts the amount of precipitation. 


\subparagraph{Wind Speed} The KF does not model accurately the high frequency variation of the wind speed. This is consistent with the limitations of ERA-I \cite{vuichard_filling_2015}. The KF cannot extract the information about the high frequency variation from other observations of the wind sped, KF is able to model higher frequency variations only if the information is present in either the control variable or in other variables. For the case of \vv{WS}, this is not the case, as ERA-I has the same limitation and no other variable has a high correlation with the wind speed. This limitation of ERA-I is also the likely reason behind the increased error in \vv{WS} when using the control for short gap length, where low variability in ERA-I is negatively affecting the model prediction.
This is scenario shows one limitation arising from the simplicity of the KF, as a properly designed Gaussian Process should be able to model the high frequency variation in \vv{WS}. Nonetheless, the KF has a better performance than the current imputation methods. 


\paragraph{Model Training}

\subparagraph{Fine-tuning} The KF achieves the best imputation performance only when the model is fine-tuned to each missing variable. 
% We tested the fine-tuning of the model both to one variable and to short gaps, with both scenarios producing an increase in the performance.
Moreover, I expect that further tuning the model to more granular conditions would improve the performance.
For instance, the rate of change of the soil temperature is significantly  higher in dry summer day compared to winter day with the ground covered in snow. Therefore, the optimal KF parameters would be different between those conditions.
Furthermore, the optimal parameters are likely different between short gaps and long gaps, as in the first case more importance should be given to the variable temporal autocorrelation, while in the second case inter-variable correlation and control variables should have a bigger weight. Therefore, I expect improvement in the KF performance if the model can specialized only on gaps with a similar length.
Finally, if the KF is applied to different EC sites the optimal parameters are likely going to be fine-tuned, as there are different climatic conditions and the error in ERA-I data (i.e. the control variables) is a very different between EC sites \cite{vuichard_filling_2015}. 

\subparagraph{Training limitations} An important outcome of this work is that the KF is able to achieve good performances, but it may be difficulty to learn the  model parameters. The initialization of the parameters with a local trend model helped to mitigate this issue, however it is probable that the current model parameters are not the optimal one. For instance, the KF performance for \vv{TS} is relatively poor for long gaps, even though is a variable with a high temporal autocorrelation and the correlation with other variables, which suggest that that limiting factor is the ability to learn and not the structure of the KF. Moreover, for short gaps, the model trained on gaps in multiple variables outperforms the model trained on gaps with only one variable missing. The numerical stability issue did not allow testing this approach on longer gaps, but it is likely that a similar pattern will be observed.


\subsection{Kalman Filter application}

\paragraph{} The results of this study indicate that a Kalman Filter can be employed to improve the imputation of meteorological variables for EC applications.

The highest error reduction is for short gaps (less than 1 day) making the KF especially suitable in this scenario. The significant improvement in the imputation of air temperature is likely relevant to reduce error in Land Surface Models. Temperature is a key driver of core ecosystem processes, like photosynthesis or respiration. Those processes have a strong non-linear dependency on temperature, hence inaccuracies in the temperature estimation can have substantial impact on the Land Surface Models output  \cite{bonan_climate_2019-2}.

For medium gaps (1 week) the relative performance of the KF is reduced, but it remains the best imputation approach. The \vv{TS} is the only variables where the KF has a worse performance than the state-of-the-art methods.
Gaps longer than a week were not tested, but the results suggest that the performance of the KF is going to get progressively closer of ERA-I. However, for the variables not available in ERA-I the performance is going to constantly decrease with longer gaps.

In any scenario, the KF provides an interpretable estimate of uncertainty of the predictions. The knowledge of imputation quality of each data point allows data users to make informed decisions on if and how to utilize the imputed data depending on each scenario. This is a significant improvement over the use of a flag system, as it is not limited to a fixed amount of values.


\paragraph{} The current KF implementation has three limitations that would prevent the application in a production scenario: numerical instability when all variables are missing for more than 15 hours, very poor performance for precipitation and physically impossible predictions of \vv{SW\_IN} at night. However, I believe that the first and third limitations are relatively straightforward to overcome, as suggested in the following section. For precipitation, instead, the KF should not be used for imputation as it is not a suitable method. Moreover, there is no indication the KF can be improved to effectively predict missing precipitation.

Another aspect that need to be considered when utilizing a KF is the need to fine-tune the parameters. A generic KF model, trained on a wide range of conditions, is able to impute gaps, however the best performance is achieved only when the KF parameters are fine-tuned to specific conditions. The need to fine-tune the parameters increase the deployment complexity and potentially the computation cost. There are different approach to deploying a KF, ranging from using only a generic model, which would be the simplest method at the cost of limited performance, to fine-tune the model to the condition of each individual gap, which would result in the best performance but the highest computational cost and complexity. 
A promising approach is to pre-train models for different conditions (e.g. variable missing, site, time of the year) then for each gap select the KF model trained on the closest conditions. The advantage of this system is the simplicity and the computational efficiency. There  only computation overhead arise from the use of variable specific models in gaps in multiple variables, which would require several iterations to complete the imputation. The main limitations of the approach are that the model parameters may be suboptimal and that it requires to train and deploy several models, one for each the combinations of conditions. Moreover, if the conditions of the gap are not similar to any trained model (e.g. a different EC site) there can be a significant decrease in performance. 
A variation of the approach above is to select not only one model trained in conditions similar to the gap, but a set of models. Then each candidate model will be used to impute artificial gaps created with conditions similar to the missing data, and the model with the smallest error will be eventually employed to impute the gap. This method is better at finding the best parameters for new conditions, but requires additional computational resources to test the different candidate models.
The last approach is fine-tune the model to the conditions of each gap. This provides the best performance and flexibility at cost of increased computational cost. Moreover, this method may also be limited by the  this may be difficult because requires an automated way to figure out when to stop training and the traning difficulties of the KF may prevent the optimization.

The necessity to fine-tune the KF to a specific conditions is a not critical limitation, but it is necessary to consider the increased computation cost and the deployment complexity. Depending on the imputation scenario the best KF deployment depending on the application (e.g. imputation of a single site or multiple sites).




\subsection{Future Outlook}

\paragraph{Kalman Filter improvements}

This work builds the foundations of Kalman Filter based method for imputing meteorological variables. However, further work is needed to develop a production ready model, explore potential improvements. 

\subparagraph{Necessary improvements} 
As describe in the previous section, there are two main issue that would prevent the use of the KF in a real world scenario.
The numerical instability of the current KF implementation limits the gaps to 15 hours when all variables are missing. The current implementation is a hybrid between a square root filter and standard Kalman Filter. The use of the full covariance matrices in the smoothing pass and the in the log-likelihood computations is the source of the numerical instability. More research is needed on developing a suitable formulation of a square root smoother, which the available literature suggest that is possible to derive \cite{rutten_square-root_2013, park_new_1996}. 

The negative predictions of \vv{SW\_IN} at night can be solved by using the KF to predict \vv{SW\_IN} during the day and replaces all the predictions with zero for the night. The exact time of the sunrise and sunset, and so when is night, can be easily computed from the day of the year and the geographic coordinates.

\subparagraph{ERA-5 Land} The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts recently released two new weather reanalysis datasets: ERA5 in 2020 \cite{hersbach_era5_2020} and ERA-5 Land  in 2021 \cite{munoz-sabater_era5-land_2021}, which supersede the ERA-Interim dataset. The ERA5-Land dataset coves only the continents, but has a much higher spatial resolution (9 km vs 80km of ERA-I) and higher temporal resolution (1 hour instead of 3 hour). Therefore, the prediction of the KF can be improved by using ERA5-Land data as control variable.

\subparagraph{Parameter initialization} My analysis suggests that initial parameters have significant influence on the final parameters and thus the performance of the model. There are several approaches to initialize a Kalman Filter \cite{durbin_time_2012} and a robust comparison between the different methods may reveal a better initialization strategy than the linear trend model.  

\pagebreak[2]

\subparagraph{Non-linear relationships} The current KF implementation is limited to model linear relationship between the state and between the control and the state. There exists non-linear version of the Kalman Filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter \cite{dan_simon_optimal_2006}, that approximate non-linear relationship between successive states.
The relation between the ERA-I data and the observed variables is also non-linear\cite{vuichard_filling_2015}. The KF does not require linear relationship between the state and the control, so any arbitrary transformation could be applied. For instance, the use of Neural Network could be assessed, which would also integrate well with the PyTorch implementation of the KF.

\subparagraph{Observations noise} One of the parameter of the KF is the observation noise ($R$). Currently this parameter is estimated by the general optimization routine, but the actual value of the observations noise can be derived from the instrument accuracy. This is a strength of the probabilistic nature of the KF and could prevent overly confident predictions. 
% uncertainty of the observations can be estimated from the instrument accuracy and used as input of the model to avoid underestimating the uncertainty of the observations. For instance, the typical accuracy of a shortwave measurement is in the order of 10 \si{W\m^2}, which is comparable to the uncertainties of the model.

\subparagraph{Model fine-tuning} One of the advantages of the iterative nature of the KF formulation is the ability to change the parameters between time step.  This opens the possibility to have a model that predicts the parameters of the filter depending on the conditions, which should overcome the necessity to fine-tune the KF parameters to each condition. This, however, may not be possible due to the difficulty of learning the parameters of the filter in the first place.

\paragraph{Model Evaluation} This study provides a first evaluation of the imputation performance of different, but a more in-depth analysis contribute to understand the impact in the real impact of the imputation methods.

The first aspect to consider is that the meteorological data is not missing completely at random. Further research would be needed, but it is reasonable to assume that there is a correlation between the gaps of different variable and that the time of the year has an impact on data availability. One reason that can contribute to patterns in the missing that is the fact that the air temperature and vapour pressure deficit are often measured from the same sensor \cite{noauthor_associated_2020, noauthor_specification_nodate}, which increase the likelihood of both variable missing at the same time. Another scenario is a station that uses solar panels, which are more likely to have power failure during winter. A robust assessment of the imputation performance should include missing data with realistic patterns.

Another aspect is to test the imputation performance using observations from different sites. EC sites are local all over the globe \cite{pastorello_fluxnet2015_2020} and the different climates may can produce different patterns in the variables temporal autocorrelation and inter-variable correlation, so affecting the performance of the KF.

The metric used for the evaluation is also important. The RMSE measure the average distance between the predictions and the observations, but does not compare characteristics of the time series such as the variance, the shape or the presence of a time-shift \cite{guen_shape_nodate}. The use of additional metrics (eg. DILATE \cite{guen_shape_nodate}) can improve the understanding of the quality of the imputation.

Finally, the performance of the KF imputation can be evaluated by computing the reduction in the error of Land Surface Models compared to state-of-the-art methods. This would allow measuring the actual impact of the improved imputation of meteorological variables.

\section{Conclusions}

The imputation of meteorological time series is necessary for the EC applications. The Kalman Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (ERA-I and MDS) for all variables, but precipitation. The strengths of the KF are: the ability to combine different imputation approaches, the effective use of the variable temporal autocorrelation and the inclusion of interpretable uncertainty in the predictions. 
% The Kalman Filter has a very good performance for short gaps (less than 1 day), but still outperforms all other methods for medium gaps (1 week).
% The results suggest that the variable temporal autocorrelation is the most important mechanism used by the KF to impute gaps, especially for short gaps. The imputation of the KF is improved by use of the control variables (i.e. ERA-I data) and by exploiting the inter-variable correlation. For gaps with a medium length (1 week) the use of ERA-I data is 
The imputation performance of the KF depends on the missing variable: the smallest error is for air temperature, air pressure, soil temperature and vapour pressure deficit. The air temperature is the variable with the biggest error reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods. The KF has an intermediate performance for the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation and the wind speed. For the wind, the KF is limited in modelling the short term variability. The KF, like the other methods, has a poor imputation performance for the precipitation, whose unique characteristics make the KF a not suitable method.

The current implementation of the Kalman Filter is affected by numerical instability issues, which limits the model to gaps 15 hours long when all variables are missing, and predicts physically impossible negative values of the shortwave radiation at night. However, both those issue can be resolved by further research. However, I identified also limitations inherited in the Kalman Filter approach: the necessary to fine-tune the parameters and the difficulties to train the model. Those issue do not prevent the use of the Kalman Filter, but may result in suboptimal predictions and in complex deployment setups.

This work shows the potential of applying the Kalman Filter for EC meteorological time series imputation, however additional work is needed to further develop the imputation method and to better and better assess its performance.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:deriv_predictions}
\begin{split}
    p(y_t^g \mid Y^{ng}) = &\int p(y^g_t \mid x_t) p(x_t \mid Y^{ng}) dx_t\\
    & = \int \norm{y_t^g}{MHx_t + Mb}{MRM^T} \norm{x^s_t}{m^s_t}{P^s_t} dx_t\\
    & = \norm{y^{ng}_t}{MHm^s_t + Mb}{MRM^T + MHP^s_tH^TM^T}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Standardized RMSE}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{RMSE}_{\text{stand}} &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^n (y^z_i - \hat{y}^z_i)^2}{n}}\\
    &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^n (\frac{(y_i - \mu_Y)}{\sigma_Y} - \frac{(\hat{y}_i - \mu_Y)}{\sigma_Y})^2}{n}}\\
    &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^n (\frac{(y_i - \mu_Y)}{\sigma_Y} - \frac{(\hat{y}_i - \mu_Y)}{\sigma_Y})^2}{n}}
\end{aligned}

 \caption{\textbf{Numerical stability} comparison between standard Kalman Filter implementation and Square Root Filter. For 100 times the filter has been initialized with random parameters (drawn from a uniform distribution range 0-1) and then filtered 100 observations. At each filter iteration, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was calculated between the state covariance from the standard filter and the square root filter. The plot shows the median, 1 and 3 quartile and the maximum of the MAE across the 100 samples.}
