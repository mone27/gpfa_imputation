  abstract = {Missing data in long-term eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux produce errors in the estimation of evapotranspiration and the water budget. Because no standard method of gap filling has been widely accepted, identification of optimal filling methods for gaps is crucial for determining total evapotranspiration. In this study we evaluate the application of a Kalman filter for filling gaps in latent heat flux data collected from an agricultural research station. The filtering approach was compared with several gap-filling methods including mean diurnal variation, multiple regressions, 2-week average Priestley–Taylor coefficient, and multiple imputation. The results demonstrated that a Kalman filtering approach developed using the relationship between latent heat flux, available energy, and vapour pressure deficit provides a closer approximation of the original data and introduces smaller errors than the other methods evaluated. Evaluation of the Kalman filter approach demonstrates the efficiency of this technique in replacing data in both small and large gaps of up to several days.},

The results show that the three simulations have the best performance for forest sites and the poorest performance for cropland and grassland sites. In addition, the three simulations have difficulties capturing the seasonality of Mediterranean and sub-tropical biomes, characterized by dry summers. This reduced simulation performance is also reflected in deficiencies in diagnosed light-use efficiency (LUE) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) dependencies compared to observations. Shortcomings in the forcing data may also play a role. These results indicate that more research is needed on the LUE and VPD functions for Mediterranean and sub-tropical biomes. Finally, this study highlights the importance of correctly representing phenology (i.e. leaf area evolution) and management (i.e. rotation–irrigation for cropland, and grazing–harvesting for grassland) to simulate the carbon dynamics of European ecosystems and the importance of ecosystem-level observations in model development and validation.},

  abstract = {We present DeepMVI, a deep learning method for missing value imputation in multidimensional time-series datasets. Missing values are commonplace in decision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from disparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of missing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety of algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods like SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning methods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics compared to just excluding the missing data. DeepMVI uses a neural network to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained patterns along a time series, and trends from related series across categorical dimensions. After failing with off-the-shelf neural architectures, we design our own network that includes a temporal transformer with a novel convolutional window feature, and kernel regression with learned embeddings. The parameters and their training are designed carefully to generalize across different placements of missing blocks and data characteristics. Experiments across nine real datasets, four different missing scenarios, comparing seven existing methods show that DeepMVI is significantly more accurate, reducing error by more than 50\% in more than half the cases, compared to the best existing method. Although slower than simpler matrix factorization methods, we justify the increased time overheads by showing that DeepMVI is the only option that provided overall more accurate analytics than dropping missing values.},

The Australian regional flux network (OzFlux) currently has 23 active sites and aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate for improved predictions. Given the need for standardised and effective data processing of flux data, we have developed a software suite, called the Dynamic INtegrated Gap-filling and partitioning for OzFlux (DINGO), that enables gap-filling and partitioning of the primary fluxes into ecosystem respiration (Fre) and gross primary productivity (GPP) and subsequently provides diagnostics and results. We outline the processing pathways and methodologies that are applied in DINGO (v13) to OzFlux data, including (1) gap-filling of meteorological and other drivers; (2) gap-filling of fluxes using artificial neural networks; (3) the \emph{u}* threshold determination; (4) partitioning into ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity; (5) random, model and \emph{u}* uncertainties; and (6) diagnostic, footprint calculation, summary and results outputs. DINGO was developed for Australian data, but the framework is applicable to any flux data or regional network. Quality data from robust systems like DINGO ensure the utility and uptake of the flux data and facilitates synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Forests dominate carbon (C) exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere on land. In the long term, the net carbon flux between forests and the atmosphere has been significantly impacted by changes in forest cover area and structure due to ecological disturbances and management activities. Current empirical approaches for estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) rarely consider forest age as a predictor, which represents variation in physiological processes that can respond differently to environmental drivers, and regrowth following disturbance. Here, we conduct an observational synthesis to empirically determine to what extent climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, forest age and management influence the spatial and interannual variability of forest NEP across 126 forest eddy-covariance flux sites worldwide. The empirical models explained up to 62\% and 71\% of spatio-temporal and across-site variability of annual NEP, respectively. An investigation of model structures revealed that forest age was a dominant factor of NEP spatio-temporal variability in both space and time at the global scale as compared to abiotic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil characteristics and climate. These findings emphasize the importance of forest age in quantifying spatio-temporal variation in NEP using empirical approaches.},

The positive result of this study is that the U-D covariance factorization algorithm has excellent numerical properties and is computationally efficient, having CPU costs that differ negligibly from the conventional Kalman costs. Accuracies of the U-D filter using single precision arithmetic consistently match the double precision reference results. Numerical stability of the U-D filter is further demonstrated by its insensitivity to variations in the a priori statistics.},

  abstract = {The Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) overestimates gross primary production (GPP) compared with data-driven estimates and other process models. We use global, spatially gridded GPP and latent heat flux upscaled from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers to evaluate and improve canopy processes in CLM4. We investigate differences in GPP and latent heat flux arising from model parameterizations (termed model structural error) and from uncertainty in the photosynthetic parameter Vcmax (termed model parameter uncertainty). Model structural errors entail radiative transfer, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and canopy scaling of leaf processes. Model structural revisions reduce global GPP over the period 1982–2004 from 165 Pg C yr−1 to 130 Pg C yr−1, and global evapotranspiration decreases from 68,000 km3 yr−1 to 65,000 km3 yr−1, within the uncertainty of FLUXNET-based estimates. Colimitation of photosynthesis is a cause of the improvements, as are revisions to photosynthetic parameters and their temperature dependency. Improvements are seen in all regions and seasonally over the course of the year. Similar improvements occur in latent heat flux. Uncertainty in Vcmax produces effects of comparable magnitude as model structural errors, but of offsetting sign. This suggests that model structural errors can be compensated by parameter adjustment, and this may explain the lack of consensus in values for Vcmax used in terrestrial biosphere models. Our analyses show that despite inherent uncertainties global flux fields empirically inferred from FLUXNET data are a valuable tool to guide terrestrial biosphere model development and evaluation.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Here we present a two-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into (a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in the UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for recovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the integration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain gauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning models by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at sub-hourly resolutions.

  abstract = {In this work, we used the MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) technique to impute missing daily data from six meteorological variables (precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and insolation) from 96 stations located in the northeast region of Brazil (NEB) for the period from 1961 to 2014. We then applied tests with a quality control system (QCS) developed for the detection, correction and possible replacement of suspicious data. Both the applied gap filling technique and the QCS showed that it was possible to solve two of the biggest problems found in time series of daily data measured in meteorological stations: the generation of plausible values for each variable of interest, in order to remedy the absence of observations, and how to detect and allow proper correction of suspicious values arising from observations.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

Those methods work well but need a large horizon of the previous events to achieve good results since they do not model the system but only rely on previously encountered iterations. In this paper, we propose to use multi-head deep attention networks to fill gaps in Micro-Meteorological Data. This methodology couples large-scale information extraction with modeling capabilities that cannot be achieved by interpolation-like techniques. Unlike Bidirectional RNNs, our architecture is not recurrent, it is simple to tune and our data efficiency is higher. We apply our architecture to real-life data and clearly show its applicability in agriculture, furthermore, we show that it could be used to solve related problems such as filling gaps in cyclic-multivariate-time-series.},

For the linear Gaussian model it shows that the likelihood can be calculated by a routine application of the Kalman filter, even when the initial state vector is fully or partially diffuse. It details the computation of the likelihood when the univariate treatment of multivariate observations is adopted. It considers how the loglikelihood can be maximised by means of iterative numerical procedures. An important part in this process is played by the score vector. The chapter shows how this is calculated, both for the case where the initial state vector has a known distribution and for the diffuse case. A useful device for maximisation of the loglikelihood in some cases, particularly in the early stages of maximisation, is the EM algorithm; details are provided for the linear Gaussian model. The chapter also considers biases in estimates due to errors in parameter estimation and ends with a discussion of some questions of goodness-of-fit and diagnostic checks.},

  abstract = {This book presents a comprehensive treatment of the state space approach to time series analysis. The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as being made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance elements, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible. Part I presents a full treatment of the construction and analysis of linear Gaussian state space models. The methods are based on the Kalman filter and are appropriate for a wide range of problems in practical time series analysis. The analysis can be carried out from both classical and Bayesian perspectives. Part I then presents illustrations to real series and exercises are provided for a selection of chapters. Part II discusses approximate and exact approaches for handling broad classes of non-Gaussian and nonlinear state space models. Approximate methods include the extended Kalman filter and the more recently developed unscented Kalman filter. The book shows that exact treatments become feasible when simulation-based methods such as importance sampling and particle filtering are adopted. Bayesian treatments based on simulation methods are also explored.}

Gaps in the long term measurements of evaporation and sensible heat flux must be filled before these data can be used for hydrological and meteorological applications. We adapted methods of gap filling for NEE (net ecosystem exchange of carbon) to energy fluxes and applied them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux eddy covariance databases. The average data coverage for the sites selected was 69\% and 75\% for latent heat (λE) and sensible heat (H). The methods were based on mean diurnal variations (half-hourly binned means of fluxes based on previous and subsequent days, MDV) and look-up tables for fluxes during assorted meteorological conditions (LookUp), and the impact of different gap filling methods on the annual sum of λE and H is investigated. The difference between annual λE filled by MDV and λE filled by LookUp ranged from −120 to 210MJm−2 per year, i.e. −48 to +86mm per year, or −13 to +39\% of the annual sum. For annual sums of H differences between −140 and +140MJm−2 per year or −12 to +19\% of the annual sum were found.},

  abstract = {Heightened awareness of global change issues within both science and political communities has increased interest in using the global network of eddy covariance flux towers to more fully understand the impacts of natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the global carbon balance. Comparisons of net ecosystem exchange (FNEE) responses are being made among biome types, phenology patterns, and stress conditions. The comparisons are usually performed on annual sums of FNEE; however, the average data coverage during a year is only 65\%. Therefore, robust and consistent gap filling methods are required. We review several methods of gap filling and apply them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux databases. The methods are based on mean diurnal variation (MDV), look-up tables (LookUp), and nonlinear regressions (Regr.), and the impact of different gap filling methods on the annual sum of FNEE is investigated. The difference between annual FNEE filled by MDV compared to FNEE filled by Regr. ranged from −45 to +200gCm−2 per year (MDV−Regr.). Comparing LookUp and Regr. methods resulted in a difference (LookUp−Regr.) ranging from −30 to +150gCm−2 per year. We also investigated the impact of replacing measurements at night, when turbulent mixing is insufficient. The nighttime correction for low friction velocities (u∗) shifted annual FNEE on average by +77gCm−2 per year, but in certain cases as much as +185gCm−2 per year. Our results emphasize the need to standardize gap filling-methods for improving the comparability of flux data products from regional and global flux networks.},

However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation. Currently, time series data imputation is a well-studied problem with different categories of methods. However, these works rarely take the temporal relations among the observations and treat the time series as normal structured data, losing the information from the time data. In recent, deep learning models have raised great attention. Time series methods based on deep learning have made progress with the usage of models like RNN, since it captures time information from data. In this paper, we mainly focus on time series imputation technique with deep learning methods, which recently made progress in this field. We will review and discuss their model architectures, their pros and cons as well as their effects to show the development of the time series imputation methods.},

This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical and deep learning-based data imputation methods on high-dimensional data from the domains of computer vision and healthcare, while additionally improving the smoothness of the imputations and providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the net CO2 flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using the eddy covariance technique have the potential to underpin our interpretation of regional CO2 source–sink patterns, CO2 flux responses to forcings, and predictions of the future terrestrial C balance. Information contained in FLUXNET eddy covariance data has multiple uses for the development and application of global carbon models, including evaluation/validation, calibration, process parameterization, and data assimilation. This paper reviews examples of these uses, compares global estimates of the dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and suggests ways of improving the utility of such data for global carbon modelling. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) predicted by different terrestrial biosphere models compares favourably with FLUXNET observations at diurnal and seasonal timescales. However, complete model validation, particularly over the full annual cycle, requires information on the balance between assimilation and decomposition processes, information not readily available for most FLUXNET sites. Site history, when known, can greatly help constrain the model-data comparison. Flux measurements made over four vegetation types were used to calibrate the land-surface scheme of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model, significantly improving simulated climate and demonstrating the utility of diurnal FLUXNET data for climate modelling. Land-surface temperatures in many regions cool due to higher canopy conductances and latent heat fluxes, and the spatial distribution of CO2 uptake provides a significant additional constraint on the realism of simulated surface fluxes. FLUXNET data are used to calibrate a global production efficiency model (PEM). This model is forced by satellite-measured absorbed radiation and suggests that global net primary production (NPP) increased 6.2\% over 1982–1999. Good agreement is found between global trends in NPP estimated by the PEM and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), and between the DGVM and estimates of global NEE derived from a global inversion of atmospheric CO2 measurements. Combining the PEM, DGVM, and inversion results suggests that CO2 fertilization is playing a major role in current increases in NPP, with lesser impacts from increasing N deposition and growing season length. Both the PEM and the inversion identify the Amazon basin as a key region for the current net terrestrial CO2 uptake (i.e. 33\% of global NEE), as well as its interannual variability. The inversion's global NEE estimate of −1.2 Pg [C] yr−1 for 1982–1995 is compatible with the PEM- and DGVM-predicted trends in NPP. There is, thus, a convergence in understanding derived from process-based models, remote-sensing-based observations, and inversion of atmospheric data. Future advances in field measurement techniques, including eddy covariance (particularly concerning the problem of night-time fluxes in dense canopies and of advection or flow distortion over complex terrain), will result in improved constraints on land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes and the rigorous attribution of mechanisms to the current terrestrial net CO2 uptake and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Global ecosystem models play a fundamental role in linking information derived from FLUXNET measurements to atmospheric CO2 variability. A number of recommendations concerning FLUXNET data are made, including a request for more comprehensive site data (particularly historical information), more measurements in undisturbed ecosystems, and the systematic provision of error estimates. The greatest value of current FLUXNET data for global carbon cycle modelling is in evaluating process representations, rather than in providing an unbiased estimate of net CO2 exchange.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks excel at function approximation, yet they are typically trained from scratch for each new function. On the other hand, Bayesian methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer the shape of a new function at test time. Yet GPs are computationally expensive, and it can be hard to design appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a family of neural models, Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the benefits of both. CNPs are inspired by the flexibility of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are structured as neural networks and trained via gradient descent. CNPs make accurate predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to complex functions and large datasets. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of the approach on a range of canonical machine learning tasks, including regression, classification and image completion.},

Finally, all propagated variables can be scaled to predictable dynamic range so that fixed point procedures can be implemented for embedded applications. A sample problem from communications signal processing is presented that includes nonlinear state dynamics, extreme time-variation, and extreme range of system eigenvalues.

To handle this challenging task, we introduce DILATE (DIstortion Loss including shApe and TimE), a new objective function for training deep neural networks. DILATE aims at accurately predicting sudden changes, and explicitly incorporates two terms supporting precise shape and temporal change detection. We introduce a differentiable loss function suitable for training deep neural nets, and provide a custom back-prop implementation for speeding up optimization. We also introduce a variant of DILATE, which provides a smooth generalization of temporally-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experiments carried out on various non-stationary datasets reveal the very good behaviour of DILATE compared to models trained with the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and also to DTW and variants. DILATE is also agnostic to the choice of the model, and we highlight its benefit for training fully connected networks as well as specialized recurrent architectures, showing its capacity to improve over state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting approaches.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We have used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear. The library is already in wide use in research, industry, and teaching. NB: This paper covers fastai v2, which is currently in pre-release at http://dev.fast.ai/},

  abstract = {Missing data is a ubiquitous problem in evaluating long-term experimental measurements, such as those associated with the FluxNet project, due to the equipment failures, system maintenance, power-failure, and lightning strikes among other things. To estimate annual values of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H), such gaps in the measured data must be filled or imputed. So far, no standardized method has been accepted and the imputation methods used are largely dependent on the researchers’ choice. Here, we used multiple imputation (MI) to gap-fill the missing data for annual estimations of NEE, LE and H at three flux sites associated with the FluxNet effort. MI is a Monte Carlo technique in which the missing values are replaced by several simulated values. Each data set imputed is a complete one where the observed values are the same as those in the original data set; only the missing values are different. Thus, the normal statistical analysis (e.g. annual total calculation) can be applied to each data set separately. The results of each analysis can be recombined into one summary. We applied the MI method to eddy covariance measurements collected from Walker Branch Watershed (WBW) site (a deciduous forest), Duke site (a coniferous forest) and Niwot site (a subalpine forest). Results showed that annual estimations of NEE, LE and H by MI were comparable to other imputation methods but MI was much easier to apply because of readily available software and standard algorithms. Besides the normal statistical analyses, MI also provided confidence intervals for each estimated parameter. This confidence interval is most useful when assessing energy, water, and carbon balance closures at a given tower site. Significant differences in annual NEE, LE and H were found among years at the three AmeriFlux sites. NEE at the Niwot Ridge site was lower and LE and H were higher than at the other two sites. With the available software and realistic gap-filling capability, MI has the potential to become a standardized method to gap-fill eddy covariance flux data for annual estimations and to improve the analysis of uncertainties associated with annual estimations of NEE, LE and H from regional and global flux networks.},

  abstract = {Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Measurement of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer by the eddy covariance technique has undergone great change in the last 2 decades. Early studies of these exchanges were confined to brief field campaigns in carefully controlled conditions followed by months of data analysis. Current practice is to run tower-based eddy covariance systems continuously over several years due to the need for continuous monitoring as part of a global effort to develop local-, regional-, continental- and global-scale budgets of carbon, water and energy. Efficient methods of processing the increased quantities of data are needed to maximise the time available for analysis and interpretation. Standardised methods are needed to remove differences in data processing as possible contributors to observed spatial variability. Furthermore, public availability of these data sets assists with undertaking global research efforts. The OzFlux data path has been developed (i) to provide a standard set of quality control and post-processing tools across the network, thereby facilitating inter-site integration and spatial comparisons; (ii) to increase the time available to researchers for analysis and interpretation by reducing the time spent collecting and processing data; (iii) to propagate both data and metadata to the final product; and (iv) to facilitate the use of the OzFlux data by adopting a standard file format and making the data available from web-based portals. Discovery of the OzFlux data set is facilitated through incorporation in FLUXNET data syntheses and the publication of collection metadata via the RIF-CS format. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to describe the data sets, along with their quality control and post-processing, for the other papers of this Special Issue. The second is to provide an example of one solution to the data collection and curation challenges that are encountered by similar flux tower networks worldwide.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Imputing hydro-meteorological missing values is essential in time series modeling. Imputation of missing values was traditionally performed after an observation period, which cannot effectively support water resources management in time. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with the missing data online. Moreover, traditional imputation methods usually consider only one observation variable and generate one set of imputations, which cannot describe the imputation uncertainty. Thus, a multiple-imputation method is proposed in this paper by integrating chain equations and random forest, namely, MICE-RF, to deal with the hydro-meteorological missing values. MICE-RF first simulates multiple imputation series to obtain the optimal imputations using the evaluation results of multiple imputation series. The traditional linear imputation, mean imputation, spline imputation, and k nearest neighbor imputation are compared to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the MICE-RF. According to the results, the MICE-RF provides the best imputation accuracy and can be easily implemented online.},

  abstract = {The conventional Kalman approach to discrete filtering involves propagation of a state estimate and an error covariance matrix from stage to stage. Alternate recursive relationships have been developed to propagate a state estimate and a square root error covariance instead. Although equivalent algebraically to the conventional approach, the square root filters exhibit improved numerical characteristics, particularly in ill-conditioned problems. In this paper, current techniques in square root filtering are surveyed and related by applying a duality association. Four efficient square root implementations are suggested, and compared with three common conventional implementations in terms of computational complexity and precision. The square root computational burden should not exceed the conventional by more than 50 percent in most practical problems. An examination of numerical conditioning predicts that the square root approach can yield twice the effective precision of the conventional filter in ill-conditioned problems. This prediction is verified in two examples. The excellent numerical characteristics and reasonable computation requirements of the square root approach make it a viable alternative to the conventional filter in many applications, particularly when computer word length is limited, or the estimation problem is badly conditioned.},

  abstract = {Methane flux (FCH4) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have increased over the past decade. FCH4 measurements commonly include data gaps, as is the case with CO2 and energy fluxes. However, gap-filling FCH4 data are more challenging than other fluxes due to its unique characteristics including multidriver dependency, variabilities across multiple timescales, nonstationarity, spatial heterogeneity of flux footprints, and lagged influence of biophysical drivers. Some researchers have applied a marginal distribution sampling (MDS) algorithm, a standard gap-filling method for other fluxes, to FCH4 datasets, and others have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to resolve the challenging characteristics of FCH4. However, there is still no consensus regarding FCH4 gap-filling methods due to limited comparative research. We are not aware of the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms beyond ANN to FCH4 datasets. Here, we compare the performance of MDS and three ML algorithms (ANN, random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]) using multiple combinations of ancillary variables. In addition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) as an input to the algorithms to address multidriver dependency of FCH4 and reduce the internal complexity of the algorithmic structures. We applied this approach to five benchmark FCH4 datasets from both natural and managed systems located in temperate and tropical wetlands and rice paddies. Results indicate that PCA improved the performance of MDS compared to traditional inputs. ML algorithms performed better when using all available biophysical variables compared to using PCA-derived inputs. Overall, RF was found to outperform other techniques for all sites. We found gap-filling uncertainty is much larger than measurement uncertainty in accumulated CH4 budget. Therefore, the approach used for FCH4 gap filling can have important implications for characterizing annual ecosystem-scale methane budgets, the accuracy of which is important for evaluating natural and managed systems and their interactions with global change processes.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

  abstract = {Reliable models are required to assess the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. Precise and independent data are essential to assess this accuracy. The flux measurements collected by the EUROFLUX project over a wide range of forest types and climatic regions in Europe allow a critical testing of the process-based models which were developed in the LTEEF project. The ECOCRAFT project complements this with a wealth of independent plant physiological measurements. Thus, it was aimed in this study to test six process-based forest growth models against the flux measurements of six European forest types, taking advantage of a large database with plant physiological parameters. The reliability of both the flux data and parameter values itself was not under discussion in this study. The data provided by the researchers of the EUROFLUX sites, possibly with local corrections, were used with a minor gap-filling procedure to avoid the loss of many days with observations. The model performance is discussed based on their accuracy, generality and realism. Accuracy was evaluated based on the goodness-of-fit with observed values of daily net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration (gC m−2 d−1), and transpiration (kg H2O m−2 d−1). Moreover, accuracy was also evaluated based on systematic and unsystematic errors. Generality was characterized by the applicability of the models to different European forest ecosystems. Reality was evaluated by comparing the modelled and observed responses of gross primary production, ecosystem respiration to radiation and temperature. The results indicated that: Accuracy. All models showed similar high correlation with the measured carbon flux data, and also low systematic and unsystematic prediction errors at one or more sites of flux measurements. The results were similar in the case of several models when the water fluxes were considered. Most models fulfilled the criteria of sufficient accuracy for the ability to predict the carbon and water exchange between forests and the atmosphere. Generality. Three models of six could be applied for both deciduous and coniferous forests. Furthermore, four models were applied both for boreal and temperate conditions. However, no severe water-limited conditions were encountered, and no year-to-year variability could be tested. Realism. Most models fulfil the criterion of realism that the relationships between the modelled phenomena (carbon and water exchange) and environment are described causally. Again several of the models were able to reproduce the responses of measurable variables such as gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration and transpiration to environmental driving factors such as radiation and temperature. Stomatal conductance appears to be the most critical process causing differences in predicted fluxes of carbon and water between those models that accurately describe the annual totals of GPP, ecosystem respiration and transpiration. As a conclusion, several process-based models are available that produce accurate estimates of carbon and water fluxes at several forest sites of Europe. This considerable accuracy fulfils one requirement of models to be able to predict the impacts of climate change on the carbon balance of European forests. However, the generality of the models should be further evaluated by expanding the range of testing over both time and space. In addition, differences in behaviour between models at the process level indicate requirement of further model testing, with special emphasis on modelling stomatal conductance realistically.},

  abstract = {The high utility of eddy covariance (EC) data has made it the cornerstone of carbon dynamics research for more than two decades. However, a substantial number of measurements from EC data can be missing for various reasons. Robust gap-filling methods are required to estimate carbon budgets from net ecosystem exchange measurements of CO2 (NEE) with high precision and accuracy. While the gap-filled methods used have provided unbiased estimates of annual NEE, little research has been done on preserving the variance structures associated with gap-filled flux data. In this project, we used EC data from a longleaf pine ecosystem located in the southeast US to investigate variance preservation in gap-filling methods. We used three non-linear regression approaches to impute artificially created gaps of different sizes via light and temperature response curves: 1) “traditional” fixed monthly window, 2) moving window, and 3) moving window with parameter prediction using physiological drivers. The results of gap-filling simulations showed that the variability of NEE estimates made with moving window and parameter prediction methods were closer to that of observed NEE, whereas the traditional method had overall lower variability. The average root mean square errors (RMSE) of predictions was lower for moving window and parameter prediction (3.38 and 3.22, respectively), versus that of the traditional method (3.42) over one year, including both daytime and nighttime data across all gap sizes. The variances associated with moving window and parameter prediction methods were 52\% and 57\%, respectively, of the observed variance, versus that of the traditional (51\%), while the average of first-order autocorrelation coefficients was 0.76 for each method compared to 0.58 for observed. The results showed that the moving window approaches provided better estimates (lower RMSEs and more similar variance) at annual scales, yet underestimated the observed variance. These results contribute toward the development of a framework of standardized gap-filling approaches which maintain variation inherent in EC data. Moreover, these results call for further research on potential environmental drivers and their interactions for inclusion in gap-filling models, as well as exploration of sampling size of estimation windows and averaging time (half hour) of flux data to promote variance maintenance and decrease the autocorrelation of predictions.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can offer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For example, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP model enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP scales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all examples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been proposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples. Importantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables control over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse GPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate inference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is variational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as an optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework, where pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the approximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters of the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can naturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from regression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification problems with discrete labels, but also problems with multidimensional labels. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new research ideas.},

  abstract = {The main theme of this thesis is analyzing and modeling large spatio-temporal datasets, such as global temperature measurements. The task is typically to extract relevant structure and features for predicting or studying the system. This can be a challenging problem because simple models are often not able to capture the complex structure suffiently well, and more sophisticated models can be computationally too expensive in practice. This thesis presents a novel spatio-temporal model which extends factor analysis by setting Gaussian process priors over the spatial and temporal components. In contrast to factor analysis, the presented model is capable of modeling complex spatial and temporal structure. Compared to standard Gaussian process regression over the spatio-temporal domain, the presented model gains substantial computational savings by operating only in the spatial or temporal domain at a time. Thus, it is feasible to model larger spatio-temporal datasets than with standard Gaussian process regression. The new model combines the modeling assumptions of several traditional techniques used for analyzing spatially and temporally distributed data: kriging is used for modeling spatial dependencies; empirical orthogonal functions reduce the dimensionality of the problem; and temporal smoothing finds relevant features from time series. The model is applied to reconstruct missing values in a historical sea surface temperature dataset. The results are promising and suggest that the proposed model may outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.},

The spatial and temporal structure is modeled by using Gaussian process priors both for the loading matrix and the factors. The posterior distributions are approximated using the variational Bayesian framework. High computational cost of Gaussian process modeling is reduced by using sparse approximations. The model is used to compute the reconstructions of the global sea surface temperatures from a historical dataset. The results suggest that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.},

  abstract = {Extreme hydrometeorological conditions typically impact ecophysiological processes on land. Satellite-based observations of the terrestrial biosphere provide an important reference for detecting and describing the spatiotemporal development of such events. However, in-depth investigations of ecological processes during extreme events require additional in situ observations. The question is whether the density of existing ecological in situ networks is sufficient for analysing the impact of extreme events, and what are expected event detection rates of ecological in situ networks of a given size. To assess these issues, we build a baseline of extreme reductions in the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), identified by a new event detection method tailored to identify extremes of regional relevance. We then investigate the event detection success rates of hypothetical networks of varying sizes. Our results show that large extremes can be reliably detected with relatively small networks, but also reveal a linear decay of detection probabilities towards smaller extreme events in log–log space. For instance, networks with ≈ 100 randomly placed sites in Europe yield a ≥ 90 \% chance of detecting the eight largest (typically very large) extreme events; but only a ≥ 50 \% chance of capturing the 39 largest events. These findings are consistent with probability-theoretic considerations, but the slopes of the decay rates deviate due to temporal autocorrelation and the exact implementation of the extreme event detection algorithm. Using the examples of AmeriFlux and NEON, we then investigate to what degree ecological in situ networks can capture extreme events of a given size. Consistent with our theoretical considerations, we find that today's systematically designed networks (i.e. NEON) reliably detect the largest extremes, but that the extreme event detection rates are not higher than would be achieved by randomly designed networks. Spatio-temporal expansions of ecological in situ monitoring networks should carefully consider the size distribution characteristics of extreme events if the aim is also to monitor the impacts of such events in the terrestrial biosphere.},

  abstract = {With the widespread application of eddy covariance technology, long-term records of hourly ecosystem mass and energy exchange are becoming available for forests around the world. These data sets hold great promise for testing and validation of models of forest function. However, model validation is not a straightforward task. The goals of this paper were to: (1) review some of the problems inherent in model validation; and (2) survey the tools available to modelers to improve validation procedures, with particular reference to eddy covariance data. A simple set of models applied to a data set of ecosystem CO2 exchange is used to illustrate our points.The major problems discussed are equifinality, insensitivity and uncertainty. Equifinality is the problem that different models, or different parameterizations of the same model, may yield similar results, making it difficult to distinguish which is correct. Insensitivity arises because the major sources of variation in eddy covariance data are the annual and diurnal cycles, which are represented by even the most basic models, and the size of the response to these cycles can mask effects of other driving variables. Uncertainty arises from three main sources: parameters, model structure and data, each of which is discussed in turn. Uncertainty is a particular issue with eddy covariance data because of the lack of replicated measurements and the potential for unquantified systematic errors such as flux loss due to advection.We surveyed several tools that improve model validation, including sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, residual analysis and model comparison. Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the use of each tool. We show that simplistic comparisons of model outputs with eddy covariance data are problematic, but use of these tools can greatly improve our confidence in model predictions.},

  abstract = {Meteorological records, including precipitation, commonly have missing values. Accurate imputation of missing precipitation values is challenging, however, because precipitation exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal variability. Data-driven spatial interpolation of meteorological records is an increasingly popular approach in which missing values at a target station are imputed using synchronous data from reference stations. The success of spatial interpolation depends on whether precipitation records at the target station are strongly correlated with precipitation records at reference stations. However, the need for reference stations to have complete datasets implies that stations with incomplete records, even though strongly correlated with the target station, are excluded. To address this limitation, we develop a new sequential imputation algorithm for imputing missing values in spatio-temporal daily precipitation records. We demonstrate the benefits of sequential imputation by incorporating it within a spatial interpolation based on a Random Forest technique. Results show that for reliable imputation, having a few strongly correlated references is more effective than having a larger number of weakly correlated references. Further, we observe that sequential imputation becomes more beneficial as the number of stations with incomplete records increases. Overall, we present a new approach for imputing missing precipitation data which may also apply to other meteorological variables.},

  abstract = {We review 15 techniques for estimating missing values of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in eddy covariance time series and evaluate their performance for different artificial gap scenarios based on a set of 10 benchmark datasets from six forested sites in Europe. The goal of gap filling is the reproduction of the NEE time series and hence this present work focuses on estimating missing NEE values, not on editing or the removal of suspect values in these time series due to systematic errors in the measurements (e.g., nighttime flux, advection). The gap filling was examined by generating 50 secondary datasets with artificial gaps (ranging in length from single half-hours to 12 consecutive days) for each benchmark dataset and evaluating the performance with a variety of statistical metrics. The performance of the gap filling varied among sites and depended on the level of aggregation (native half-hourly time step versus daily), long gaps were more difficult to fill than short gaps, and differences among the techniques were more pronounced during the day than at night. The non-linear regression techniques (NLRs), the look-up table (LUT), marginal distribution sampling (MDS), and the semi-parametric model (SPM) generally showed good overall performance. The artificial neural network based techniques (ANNs) were generally, if only slightly, superior to the other techniques. The simple interpolation technique of mean diurnal variation (MDV) showed a moderate but consistent performance. Several sophisticated techniques, the dual unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the multiple imputation method (MIM), the terrestrial biosphere model (BETHY), but also one of the ANNs and one of the NLRs showed high biases which resulted in a low reliability of the annual sums, indicating that additional development might be needed. An uncertainty analysis comparing the estimated random error in the 10 benchmark datasets with the artificial gap residuals suggested that the techniques are already at or very close to the noise limit of the measurements. Based on the techniques and site data examined here, the effect of gap filling on the annual sums of NEE is modest, with most techniques falling within a range of ±25gCm−2year−1.},

But while imputation in general is well covered within R, it is hard to find functions for imputation of univariate time series. The problem is, most standard imputation techniques can not be applied directly. Most algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an overview of univariate time series imputation in general and an in-detail insight into the respective implementations within R packages. Furthermore, we experimentally compare the R functions on different time series using four different ratios of missing data. Our results show that either an interpolation with seasonal kalman filter from the zoo package or a linear interpolation on seasonal loess decomposed data from the forecast package were the most effective methods for dealing with missing data in most of the scenarios assessed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.  The full ERA5-Land hourly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In the last 20 years, the FLUXNET network provided unique measurements of CO2, energy and other greenhouse gas exchanges between ecosystems and atmosphere measured with the eddy covariance technique. These data have been widely used in different and heterogeneous applications, and FLUXNET became a reference source of information not only for ecological studies but also in modeling and remote sensing applications. The data are, in general, collected, processed and shared by regional networks or by single sites, and for this reason it is difficult for users interested in analyses involving multiple sites to easily access a coherent and standardized dataset. For this reason, periodic FLUXNET collections have been released in the last 15~years, every 5 to 10~years, with data standardized and shared under the same data use policy. However, the new tools available for data analysis and the need to constantly monitor the relations between ecosystem behavior and climate change require a reorganization of FLUXNET in order to increase the data interoperability, reduce the delay in the data sharing and facilitate the data use, all this while keeping in mind the great effort made by the site teams to collect these unique data and respecting the different regional and national network organizations and data policies. Here a proposal for a new organization of FLUXNET is presented with the aim of stimulating a discussion for the needed developments. In this new scheme, the regional and national networks become the pillars of the global initiative, organizing clusters and becoming responsible for the processing, preparation and distribution of datasets that users will be able to access in real time and with a machine-to-machine tool, obtaining always the most updated collection possible but keeping a high standardization and common data policy. This will also lead to an increase in the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) of the FLUXNET data that will ensure a larger impact of the unique data produced and a proper data management and traceability.},

  abstract = {We present an approach that uses a deep learning model, in particular, a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), for estimating the missing values of a variable in multivariate time series data. We focus on filling a long continuous gap (e.g., multiple months of missing daily observations) rather than on individual randomly missing observations. Our proposed gap filling algorithm uses an automated method for determining the optimal MLP model architecture, thus allowing for optimal prediction performance for the given time series. We tested our approach by filling gaps of various lengths (three months to three years) in three environmental datasets with different time series characteristics, namely daily groundwater levels, daily soil moisture, and hourly Net Ecosystem Exchange. We compared the accuracy of the gap-filled values obtained with our approach to the widely-used R-based time series gap filling methods ImputeTS and mtsdi. The results indicate that using an MLP for filling a large gap leads to better results, especially when the data behave nonlinearly. Thus, our approach enables the use of datasets that have a large gap in one variable, which is common in many long-term environmental monitoring observations.},

The main feature of the new algorithms is that they use unitary rotations to replace all matrix inversion and backsubstitution steps common in earlier algorithms with unitary operations; this feature enables more efficient systolic array and parallel implementations and leads to algorithms with better numerical stability and conditioning properties.},

We envision how such a model may facilitate cooperation between members of the community. We show preliminary results on the first step of the roadmap, where we instantiate an architecture that can process a wide variety of geospatial data modalities and demonstrate that it can achieve competitive performance with domain-specific architectures on tasks relating to the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals.},

  abstract = {Pioneering work in the last century has resulted in a widely accepted paradigm that primary production is strongly positively related to temperature and water availability such that the northern hemispheric forest carbon sink may increase under conditions of global warming. However, the terrestrial carbon sink at the ecosystem level (i.e. net ecosystem productivity, NEP) depends on the net balance between gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (TER). Through an analysis of European eddy covariance flux data sets, we find that the common climate relationships for primary production do not hold for NEP. This is explained by the fact that decreases in GPP are largely compensated by parallel decreases in TER when climatic factors become more limiting. Moreover, we found overall that water availability was a significant modulator of NEP, while the multivariate effect of mean annual temperature is small and not significant. These results indicate that climate- and particularly temperature-based projections of net carbon balance may be misleading. Future research should focus on interactions between the water and carbon cycles and the effects of disturbances on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods that separate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into its major components, gross ecosystem carbon uptake (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems. We show that the temperature sensitivity of Reco, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach {$>$}25\% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP. Conversely, in summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems, the long-term temperature sensitivity is lower than the short-term temperature sensitivity resulting in underestimation of annual sums of respiration. We introduce a new generic algorithm that derives a short-term temperature sensitivity of Reco from eddy covariance data that applies this to the extrapolation from night- to daytime, and that further performs a filling of data gaps that exploits both, the covariance between fluxes and meteorological drivers and the temporal structure of the fluxes. While this algorithm should give less biased estimates of GEP and Reco, we discuss the remaining biases and recommend that eddy covariance measurements are still backed by ancillary flux measurements that can reduce the uncertainties inherent in the eddy covariance data.},

We selected a location at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hanford site to demonstrate and evaluate the new method, using a 10-year spatio5 temporal hydrological dataset of temperature, specific conductance, and groundwater table elevation from 42 wells that monitor the dynamic and heterogeneous hydrologic exchanges between the Columbia River and its adjacent groundwater aquifer.

The meteorological gap-filling method ingests data from nearby towers or climate stations and uses simple interpolation techniques to fill missing half-hourly data values. These gap-filled forcing datasets are uncertain because of the gap-filling technique and because of potential biases in the tower observations such as the underestimation of precipitation or poor calibration of radiometers. Here we examine the effects of uncertainty in this forcing dataset at selected sites with two models. For each site, an ensemble of 10 forcing datasets is created using varying methods of bias correction, interpolation, and selection of nearby sites for gap-filling. We include the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset as one of the ensemble members to quantify uncertainties caused by using reanalysis data. We examine the effects of forcing uncertainty on net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re) and latent heat (LE) at multiple timescales, with a particular focus on the interannual variability of these flux variables. We also examine the sensitivity of fluxes at each site to individual uncertainties in three variables: temperature, precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).},

Propagating these factors offers both computational efficiencies and greatly improved numerical properties. This paper introduces a new method of implementing the square-root unscented filter and the square-root unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, which provide similar computational and numerical advantages over their traditional implementations. The new algorithms rely on the QR factorisation for calculating the covariance square-roots. A comparison with the previous development of the square-root unscented filter shows similar computational cost, while dramatically simplifying the implementation and improving numerical stability.},

Existing methods either do not directly handle irregularly-sampled data or degrade severely with sparsely observed data. In this work, we reformulate time series as permutation-equivariant sets and propose a novel imputation model NRTSI that does not impose any recurrent structures. Taking advantage of the permutation equivariant formulation, we design a principled and efficient hierarchical imputation procedure. In addition, NRTSI can directly handle irregularly-sampled time series, perform multiple-mode stochastic imputation, and handle data with partially observed dimensions. Empirically, we show that NRTSI achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series imputation benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Missing data, which commonly appears in multivariate time series, has been widely recognized as a key challenge in time series analysis. Many commonly used imputation methods either ignore the temporal dependencies of time series data, or do not adequately utilize the relationships among variables. State-ofthe-art methods on time series imputation are built on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which utilize the historical information to estimate current values sequentially. However, RNNs rely heavily on the output of nearby timestamps, which may lead to important information lost for long sequences. Moreover, individual variables typically present different dynamics and missingness patterns, which is neglected by the global RNN hidden states. In this paper, we propose an imputation framework to learn both global and local dependencies of multivariate time series, as well as a multi-dimensional self-attention to learn capture distant correlations across both time and feature. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task, and benefits the downstream task.},

  abstract = {Abstract A regression-based approach for temperature data reconstruction has been used to fill the gaps in the series of automatic temperature records obtained from the meteorological network of Veneto Region (northeastern Italy). The method presented is characterized by a dynamic selection of the reconstructing stations and of the coupling period that can precede or follow the missing data. Each gap is considered as a specific case, identifying the best set of stations and the period that minimizes the estimated reconstruction error for the gap, thus permitting a potentially better adaptation to time-dependent factors affecting the relationships between stations. The best sampling size is determined through an inference procedure, permitting a highly specific selection of the parameters used to fill each gap in the time series. With a proper selection of the parameters, the average errors of reconstruction are close to 0 and those corresponding to the 95th percentile are typically around 0.1°C. In comparison with similar regression-based approaches, the errors are lower, particularly for minimum temperatures, and the method limits inversions between the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures.},

The main approach is to estimate the missing data based on values of other meteorological variables measured at the same time in the same local, since the meteorological variables are strongly related. Experimental tests showed the performance of Mannga compared with other two methods typically used by researches in this area. Good results were achieved, with high accuracy even for sequential failures, which is a big challenge for researchers. The core advantages of Mannga are the flexibility of handling different types of meteorological data, the ability of select the best variables to assist the gap filling and the capacity to deal with sequential failures. Moreover, the method is available to public use with the Java programming language.},

  abstract = {Half-hourly time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) measured through the micro-meteorological eddy covariance (EC) technique are noisy and show a high percentage of missing data. By using EC measurements that are part of the FLUXNET2015 dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multiple imputation (MI) strategy based on an efficient computational strategy introduced in Honaker and King (2010), combining the classic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a bootstrap approach, in order to take draws from a suitable approximation of posterior distribution of model parameters. Armed with these instruments, we are able to introduce three new multiple imputation models, characterized by an increasing level of complexity, and built on top of multivariate normality assumption: 1) MLR, which imputes EC missing values using a static multiple linear regression of observed values of suitable input variables; 2) ADL, which enriches with dynamic properties the static specification of MLR, by considering an autoregressive distributed lag specification; 3) PADL, which adds further complexity by embedding the ADL model in a panel-data perspective. Under several artificial gap scenarios, we show that PADL has a better ability in modeling the complex dynamics of ecosystem fluxes and reconstructing missing data points, thus providing unbiased imputations and preserving the original sampling distribution. The added flexibility arising from the time series cross section structure of PADL warrants improved performances, outperforming those of other imputation methods, as well as of the marginal distribution sampling algorithm (MDS), a widely used gapfilling approach introduced by Reichstein et al. (2005), especially in the case of nighttime flux data. It is expected that the strategy proposed in this paper will become useful in creating multiple imputations for a variety of EC datasets, providing valid inferences for a broad range of scientific estimands (such as annual budgets).},

Currently, the FLUXNET database contains more than 500 registered sites, and up to 250 of them share data (free fair-use data set). Many modelling groups use the FLUXNET data set for evaluating ecosystem models' performance, but this requires uninterrupted time series for the meteorological variables used as input. Because original in situ data often contain gaps, from very short (few hours) up to relatively long (some months) ones, we develop a new and robust method for filling the gaps in meteorological data measured at site level. Our approach has the benefit of making use of continuous data available globally (ERA-Interim) and a high temporal resolution spanning from 1989 to today. These data are, however, not measured at site level, and for this reason a method to downscale and correct the ERA-Interim data is needed. We apply this method to the level 4 data (L4) from the La Thuile collection, freely available after registration under a fair-use policy. The performance of the developed method varies across sites and is also function of the meteorological variable. On average over all sites, applying the bias correction method to the ERA-Interim data reduced the mismatch with the in situ data by 10 to 36 \%, depending on the meteorological variable considered. In comparison to the internal variability of the in situ data, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the in situ data and the unbiased ERA-I (ERA-Interim) data remains relatively large (on average over all sites, from 27 to 76 \% of the standard deviation of in situ data, depending on the meteorological variable considered). The performance of the method remains poor for the wind speed field, in particular regarding its capacity to conserve a standard deviation similar to the one measured at FLUXNET stations. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The ERA-Interim reanalysis data de-biased at FLUXNET sites can be downloaded from the PANGAEA data centre ({$<$}a href="http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.838234" target="\_blank"{$>$}http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.838234{$<$}/a{$>$}).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, LULCC detection and modelling is a complex, data-driven process in the remote sensing field due to the processing of massive historical and current data, real-time interaction of scenario data, and spatial environmental data. In this paper, we review principles and methods of LULCC modelling, using machine learning and beyond, such as traditional cellular automata (CA). Then, we examine the characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and perspectives of machine learning. Machine learning has not yet been dramatic in modelling LULCC, such as urbanization prediction and crop yield prediction because competition and transition between land cover types are dynamic at a local scale under varying natural drivers and human activities. Upcoming challenges of machine learning in modelling LULCC remain in the detection and prediction of LULC evolutionary processes if considering their applicability and feasibility, such as the spatio-temporal transition mechanisms to describe occurrence, transition, spreading, and spatial patterns of changes, availability of training data of all the change drivers, particularly sequence data, and identification and inclusion of local ecological, hydrological, and social-economic drivers in addressing the spectral feature change. This review points out the need for multidisciplinary research beyond image processing and pattern recognition of machine learning in accelerating and advancing studies of LULCC modelling. Despite this, we believe that machine learning has strong potentials to incorporate new exploratory variables in modelling LULCC through expanding remote sensing big data and advancing transient algorithms.},

These flux measurements are a main source for understanding biosphere–atmosphere interactions and feedbacks through cross-site analysis, model–data integration, and upscaling. The raw fluxes measured with the EC technique require extensive and laborious data processing. While there are standard tools\textsuperscript{1} available in an open-source environment for processing high-frequency (10 or 20\&thinsp;Hz) data into half-hourly quality-checked fluxes, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for the subsequent post-processing steps. We tackled this need by developing the REddyProc package in the cross-platform language R that provides standard CO\textsubscript{2}-focused post-processing routines for reading (half-)hourly data from different formats, estimating the \emph{u}\textsubscript{*} threshold, as well as gap-filling, flux-partitioning, and visualizing the results. In addition to basic processing, the functions are extensible and allow easier integration in extended analysis than current tools. New features include cross-year processing and a better treatment of uncertainties. A comparison of REddyProc routines with other state-of-the-art tools resulted in no significant differences in monthly and annual fluxes across sites. Lower uncertainty estimates of both \emph{u}\textsubscript{*} and resulting gap-filled fluxes by 50\&thinsp;\% with the presented tool were achieved by an improved treatment of seasons during the bootstrap analysis. Higher estimates of uncertainty in daytime partitioning (about twice as high) resulted from a better accounting for the uncertainty in estimates of temperature sensitivity of respiration. The provided routines can be easily installed, configured, and used. Hence, the eddy covariance community will benefit from the REddyProc package, allowing easier integration of standard post-processing with extended analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}\textsuperscript{1}{$<$}a href="http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/2017/10/10/toolbox-a-rolling-list-of-softwarepackages-for-flux-related-data-processing/" target="\_blank"{$>$}http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/2017/10/10/toolbox-a-rolling-list-of-softwarepackages-for-flux-related-data-processing/{$<$}/a{$>$}, last access: 17 August 2018{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Complete and high-resolution temperature observation data are important input parameters for agrometeorological disaster monitoring and ecosystem modelling. Due to the limitation of field meteorological observation conditions, observation data are commonly missing, and an appropriate data imputation method is necessary in meteorological data applications. In this paper, we focus on filling long gaps in meteorological observation data at field sites. A deep learning-based model, BiLSTM-I, is proposed to impute missing half-hourly temperature observations with high accuracy by considering temperature observations obtained manually at a low frequency. An encoder-decoder structure is adopted by BiLSTM-I, which is conducive to fully learning the potential distribution pattern of data. In addition, the BiLSTM-I model error function incorporates the difference between the final estimates and true observations. Therefore, the error function evaluates the imputation results more directly, and the model convergence error and the imputation accuracy are directly related, thus ensuring that the imputation error can be minimized at the time the model converges. The experimental analysis results show that the BiLSTM-I model designed in this paper is superior to other methods. For a test set with a time interval gap of 30 days, or a time interval gap of 60 days, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) remain stable, indicating the model’s excellent generalization ability for different missing value gaps. Although the model is only applied to temperature data imputation in this study, it also has the potential to be applied to other meteorological dataset-filling scenarios.},

  abstract = {For the real-world time series analysis, data missing is a ubiquitously existing problem due to anomalies during data collecting and storage. If not treated properly, this problem will seriously hinder the classification, regression, or related tasks. Existing methods for time series imputation either impose too strong assumptions on the distribution of missing data or cannot fully exploit, even simply ignore, the informative temporal dependencies and feature correlations across different time steps. In this article, inspired by the idea of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose a generative adversarial learning framework for time series imputation under the condition of observed data (as well as the labels, if possible). In our model, we employ a modified bidirectional RNN structure as the generator G, which is aimed at generating the missing values by taking advantage of the temporal and nontemporal information extracted from the observed time series. The discriminator D is designed to distinguish whether each value in a time series is generated or not so that it can help the generator to make an adjustment toward a more authentic imputation result. For an empirical verification of our model, we conduct imputation and classification experiments on several real-world time series data sets. The experimental results show an eminent improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline models.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a ubiquitous problem. It is especially challenging in medical settings because many streams of measurements are collected at different – and often irregular – times. Accurate estimation of those missing measurements is critical for many reasons, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Existing methods address this estimation problem by interpolating within data streams or imputing across data streams (both of which ignore important information) or ignoring the temporal aspect of the data and imposing strong assumptions about the nature of the data-generating process and/or the pattern of missing data (both of which are especially problematic for medical data). We propose a new approach, based on a novel deep learning architecture that we call a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN) that interpolates within data streams and imputes across data streams. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to five real-world medical datasets. We show that it provides dramatically improved estimation of missing measurements in comparison to 11 state-of-the-art benchmarks (including Spline and Cubic Interpolations, MICE, MissForest, matrix completion and several RNN methods); typical improvements in Root Mean Square Error are between 35\% - 50\%. Additional experiments based on the same five datasets demonstrate that the improvements provided by our method are extremely robust.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth low-dimensional neural trajectories'' that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from tens to hundreds of neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional noisy spiking activity in a compact denoised form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the data are firstdenoised'' by smoothing over time, then a static dimensionality reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way, and account for spiking variability that may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that GPFA provided a better characterization of the population activity than the two-stage methods. From the extracted single-trial neural trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect suggestive of attractor dynamics that was shown indirectly by previous studies.},

  abstract = {Digital agriculture increasingly relies on the availability and accuracy of measurement data collected from various sensors. Of this data, water quality attracts great attention due to its intended use for crop irrigation, livestock, and other farming activities. Accurate and reliable water quality measurements enable farmers to understand the landscape comprehensively, optimising resource utilisation and reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment. In practice, missing and incomplete data can create biased estimations and reduce the efficiency of many of the valuable applications provided by digital agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to propose a dual-head sequence-to-sequence imputation model (Dual-SSIM) designed to impute missing time series data in sensor networks, therefore reducing the negative consequences of missing and incomplete data. Unlike standard sequence-to-sequence architecture, the Dual-SSIM model features two encoders with gated recurrent units (GRUs) which are used to process temporal information before and after the missing gap separately. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is applied to two encoder outputs concurrently, in order to allow the model to focus on the high relative inputs when estimating missing data. The performance efficacy of Dual-SSIM has been investigated through the monitoring of water quality, sourced from an Australian water quality information system. Experimental results of this investigation indicate that Dual-SSIM outperforms associated alternatives based on the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and dynamic time warping (DTW) scores in imputing two different water quality variables. Therefore, it can be concluded that Dual-SSIM provides an effective and promising approach for water quality data imputation.},

  abstract = {We analyze how biases of meteorological drivers impact the calculation of ecosystem CO2, water and energy fluxes by models. To do so, we drive the same ecosystem model by meteorology from gridded products and by meteorology from local observation at eddy-covariance flux sites. The study is focused on six flux tower sites in France spanning across a climate gradient of 7–14 °C annual mean surface air temperature and 600–1040 mm mean annual rainfall, with forest, grassland and cropland ecosystems. We evaluate the results of the ORCHIDEE process-based model driven by meteorology from four different analysis data sets against the same model driven by site-observed meteorology. The evaluation is decomposed into characteristic time scales. The main result is that there are significant differences in meteorology between analysis data sets and local observation. The phase of seasonal cycle of air temperature, humidity and shortwave downward radiation is reproduced correctly by all meteorological models (average R2 = 0.90). At sites located in altitude, the misfit of meteorological drivers from analysis data sets and tower meteorology is the largest. We show that day-to-day variations in weather are not completely well reproduced by meteorological models, with R2 between analysis data sets and measured local meteorology going from 0.35 to 0.70. The bias of meteorological driver impacts the flux simulation by ORCHIDEE, and thus would have an effect on regional and global budgets. The forcing error, defined by the simulated flux difference resulting from prescribing modeled instead of observed local meteorology drivers to ORCHIDEE, is quantified for the six studied sites at different time scales. The magnitude of this forcing error is compared to that of the model error defined as the modeled-minus-observed flux, thus containing uncertain parameterizations, parameter values, and initialization. The forcing error is on average smaller than but still comparable to model error, with the ratio of forcing error to model error being the largest on daily time scale (86\%) and annual time scales (80\%). The forcing error incurred from using a gridded meteorological data set to drive vegetation models is therefore an important component of the uncertainty budget of regional CO2, water and energy fluxes simulations, and should be taken into consideration in up-scaling studies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{3}, and CO\textsubscript{2}. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16–19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO\textsubscript{2}, CO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{3}) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14 \% relative error), 10 ppm for CO\textsubscript{2} (2 \% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO\textsubscript{2} (29 \% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O\textsubscript{3} (15 \% relative error), and Pearson \emph{r} versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO\textsubscript{2} and CO\textsubscript{2}. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO\textsubscript{2} concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
