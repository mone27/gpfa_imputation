# 1. Introduction

## About me

- just finished master in Forest and Ecosystem Sciences at university of GÃ¶ttingen
- master thesis 

## Background

-   

Eddy Covariance (EC) tower measures also meteorological variables (eg. air temperature, wind speed)
-   technical issues (eg. broken sensor) result in **meteo time series** with **gaps**
-   Presence of gaps is a problem in many EC data applications (eg. ecosystem modelling)
- over 98% f gaps are shorter than a week

## How to impute gaps

in multivariate time series:

- use other observations before and after the gap and exploit the variable temporal autocorrelation
- use statistical dependency with other (non missing) variables
- use other timeseries that measure similar variables

## State of the art

1. Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS)
  
  - use mean of all other observations from similar meteorological conditions (close in time and in values of other variables)
  - most commonly used method and default for short gaps
  
2. Global meteorological dataset (ERA-I)

  - global dataset using weather models
  - limited spatial/temporal resolution
  - not all variables are available
  
## Example imputation

![](`r here::here("manuscript/Master Thesis - Evaluation of Kalman filter for meteorological time series imputation for Eddy Covariance applications - Simone Massaro/images/timeseries_sota.svg")`)

## Potentail for Improvements

- **temporal autocorrelation**: observations closer to the gap should have a stronger weight in the prediction

- **combine imputation approaches**: use information both from the local time series and the global dataset 

- **Uncertainty**: provide a quantifiable and interpretable uncertainty in the predictions

## Contributions of this work

develop a new imputation methods that uses Kalman Filter as it allows to:
  - use variable temporal autocorrelation
  - use inter-variable correlation
  - use global dataset
  - uncertainty of predictions
  - computationally efficient
  
- assess the KF imputation performance and the aspect 

expect limited performance for long gaps

# Kalman Filter

## Kalman Filter assumptions

- the observed variables ($y_t$) depend on a latent state of system
- the latent states ($x_t$) are connected by a Markov Chain $p(x_t|x_{t-1}) = p(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \hdots, x_0)$
- all distributions are Gaussian and relationship are linear



## Kalman Filter for imputation

- predict time at next time state ($x_{t+1}$) using current state ($x_{t+1}$) and potentially a control variable
- correct the state distribution using the observed variable ($y_t$) **if available**
- if the 


## Kalman Filter with equations

$$
\begin{align}
p(x_t | x_{t-1}) &= \mathcal{N}(x_t; Ax_{t-1} + d + Bc_t, Q) \\
p(y_t | x_t) &= \mathcal{N}(y_t; Hx_t + b, R)
\end{align}
$$

## Kalman Filter with images


## Kalman Filter implementation

- KF equations derived using Bayesian inference + properties of Gaussian distributions
- naive equations are numerically unstable
- custom implementation in PyTorch

## Model training

- artificial gaps
- find optimal parameters using gradient descend

# Results

## KF vs SoTA



# Discussion and Conclusions

## Conclusions

- KF consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods
- KF provides uncertainty predictions
- imputation performance changes a lot between variables
- numerical stability issues limit applications of current implementation for long gaps in all variables
- difficult to train the KF: parameters initialisation and training data

![plot of distribution of small gaps (<1 week) for all `TA`, `SW_IN` and `VPD` for all sites. 26 millions total obs](plots_18_jan/gap_len_dist_small.png)

## How to fill gaps

1.  use previous and following measurements for one variable and temporal auto-correlation (eg. diurnal cycles)
2.  correlation with other variables measures (eg. solar radiation and temperature)
3.  other measurements of meteo variables (eg. nearby station)

## State of the art

OneFlux pipeline (Fluxnet + ICOS + AmeriFlux)

- Short and medium gaps using Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS)

- Long gaps filled with ERA data (global meteo dataset) using linear transformation to reduce site bias
    
## How MDS (Marginal Distribution Sampling) works {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- take a time window (7 days) around the gap
- use 3 predictors variables (`TA`, `SW_IN` and `VPD`) and divide them in n discrete bins
- for each bin (combination of conditions) find the average value of the missing variable
- for each gap find the closest condition and fill with the average value
- if necessary increase the time window 
- quality flag depends on the time window size

## Current approaches limitations

-   don't consider the observations before and after the gap
-   Either MDS (variable correlation) or ERA data, don't combine the information
-   No uncertainty for the predictions (only a quality flag)

## Thesis goal

-   develop model to impute missing data in meteorological time series
-   include all 3 imputation approaches
-   provide an uncertainty of the predictions


# 3. Model: Kalman Filter

## How Kalman Filter works

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
Models over time a **latent** variable (we are not observing it), the **state** of the system.

The current state $x_t$ depends using:

1. the previous state $\color{blue}{x_{t-1}}$
2. current observation $\color{green}{y_t}$
3. control variable $\color{purple}{c_t}$ (ERA data)

## 1. Previous state {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column}
$$ x_t = A\color{blue}{x_{t-1}} + \varepsilon $$
where:

- $x_{t}$ is the current state
- $\color{blue}{x_{t-1}}$ is the previous state
- $A$ is a linear transformation of $\color{blue}{x_{t-1}}$
- $\varepsilon$ is the "process" noise which is a random variable with a normal distribution with mean 0

- $H$ is a linear transformation of $\color{green}{y_{t}}$
- $\nu$ is the "observation" noise which is a random variable with a normal distribution with mean 0

using the rules of probabilistic inference if we observe $y_t$ you can update the distribution of $x_t$

## How to find model parameters {.incremental}

- create artificial gaps
- predicting gap in the model
- compute the log likelihood of the predictions
- maximise the log likelihood

## Kalman Filter

pros:

- Probabilist model: the output of the model is a **distribution of predictions**, not a single value
- Combines **all** 3 approaches to gap filling in one model
- interpretable paramters
- computationally efficient

cons:

- keeps tracks only of the local state

  - n observations before after/gap
  - how to best generate artificial gaps
- How to assess the model?

## Use of gap filling
  
- what is the impact of better gap filling for data users?
  - why better filling for short/medium gaps is useful
  - how can the uncertainty be used

## How to assess the model? settings

- how to choose gap lengths?
- how to choose number of variables missing?
- which variable to focus on?


## How to assess the model? Metrics

- RMSE - interpretation difficult as it's relative to the variable
- r2 - gaps are often too short to interpret properly
