    "Eddy Covariance (EC) is a state-of-the-art technique to measure greenhouse gases exchanges. EC towers include measurement of meteorological variables, but due to instrument failures the data is not always available. Many use cases of EC data, especially land surface modelling, require continuous meteorological time series as input. Therefore, it is necessary to impute the gaps in the meteorological time series. ONEFlux, one of the most widely used EC post-processing pipeline, imputes the missing data using either Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS), which uses other observations from similar meteorological conditions, or ERA-Interim (ERA-I), which is a global meteorological dataset. The imputation performance of those methods is limited for short and medium gaps (up to 1 week), which constitute the majority of EC meteorological gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, I assess an imputation method for meteorological variables based on a Kalman Filter (KF).\n",
    "It has the advantages of combining in the prediction information from the ERA-I dataset, inter-variable correlation and  temporal autocorrelation. Moreover, the KF is a probabilistic method, so for each data point the prediction is not a single value but an entire distribution, which provides an interpretable quantification of uncertainty of the model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I evaluate the KF by  comparing the imputation performance with the state-of-the-art approaches (MDS and ERA-I) using data from the FLUXNET 2015 site of Hainich (DE-Hai) with gaps up to one week long. The KF outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across all analyzed variables, except for precipitation, for which all methods are comparable. I observed an average reduction of the imputation error of 33 \\% compared to ERA-I and  57 \\% compared to MDS, when excluding precipitation. I further explore aspects that influence the performance of the KF: in general the error increases with the gap length only up to 24 hours, the use of ERA-I data improves the model predictions and the inter-variable correlation is effectively utilized.\n",
    "The main limitations of KF approach are: 1) the best performance is achieved only when fine-tuning the model parameters to the specific conditions of the gap, which increases the deployment complexity; 2) the current implementation of the KF is affected by numerical stability issues, which in case all variables are missing limits the maximum gap length to 15 hours; 3) careful initialization of the KF parameters and selection of the training conditions are required to mitigate the difficulty in learning the models parameters. However, I expect that all those issues can be resolved or at least significantly mitigated by further research.\n"
